<h3>WHERE DREAMLAND BEGAN</h3>


<p>According to the calendar it was winter;
but between Mentone and the frontier
town of Ventimiglia, on the white road inlaid
like a strip of ivory on dark rocks above the
sapphire of the Mediterranean, it was fierce
summer in the sunshine. A girl riding between
two men, reined in her chestnut mare at a
cross-road which led into the jade-green twilight
of an olive grove. The men pulled up
their horses also, and all three came to a sudden
halt at a bridge flung across a swift but shallow
river, whose stony bed cleft the valley.</p>

<p>The afternoon sunshine poured down upon
them, burnishing the coils of the girl's hair to
gold, and giving a dazzling brilliancy to a complexion
which for twenty years to come need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
not fear the light of day. She was gazing up
the valley shut in on either side with thickly
wooded hills, their rugged heads still gilded,
their shoulders already half in shadow; but the
eyes of the men rested only upon her. One
was English, the other Italian; and it was the
Italian whose look devoured her beauty, moving
hungrily from the shining tendrils of gold that
curled at the back of her white neck, up to the
small pink ear almost hidden with a thick, rippling
wave of hair; so to the piquant profile which
to those who loved Virginia Beverly, was dearer
than cold perfection.</p>

<p>"Oh, the olive woods!" she exclaimed. "How
sweet they are! See the way the sunshine
touches the old, gnarled trunks, and what a
lovely light filters through the leaves. One
never sees it anywhere except in an olive grove.
I should like to live in one."</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" laughed the Englishman.
"What prevents you from buying two or three?
But you would soon tire of them, my child,
as you do of everything as soon as it belongs
to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's not fair," replied the girl. "Besides,
if it were, who has helped to spoil me? I <i>will</i>
buy an olive grove, and you shall see if I tire of
it. Come, let's ride up the valley, and find out
if there are any for sale. It looks heavenly cool
after this heat."</p>

<p>"You'll soon discover that it's too cool," said
the Italian, in perfect English. "The sun is
only in these valleys for a few hours, and it's
gone for the day now. Besides, there's nothing
interesting here. One sees the best from
where we stand."</p>

<p>Virginia Beverly turned her eyes upon him,
and let them dwell on his face questioningly.
"Of course, you must know every inch of this
country," she said, "as you used to live just
across the Italian border."</p>

<p>For once he did not answer her look. "I
haven't spent much time here for several years.
Paris has absorbed me," he said evasively.
"One forgets a good deal; but if you want to see
a really charming valley, we had better go
farther on. Then I think I can show you one."</p>

<p>Virginia's pretty brows, which were many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
shades darker than her hair, drew together.
"But I don't want to go farther," she said.
"And I like this valley."</p>

<p>"Spoilt child!" ejaculated the Englishman,
who claimed rights of cousinship, though by
birth Virginia was American.</p>

<p>At that moment two members of the riding
party, who had contrived to be left behind, came
leisurely up. One was a very handsome, dark
woman, who succeeded in looking not more than
thirty, the other a young man of twenty-five,
enough like Virginia to suggest that they were
brother and sister.</p>

<p>"What are you stopping for?" inquired Lady
Gardiner, who would not have been sorry to
keep her friends in advance.</p>

<p>"Waiting for you," said Virginia promptly.
"I want to explore this valley."</p>

<p>As she spoke she gave her mare a little pat
on the velvety neck. The animal, which was
Virginia's own, brought from her namesake
state, had never known the touch of the whip,
but understood the language of hand and voice.
She went off at a trot up the shadowed road;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and the Marchese Loria was the first to follow.
But he bit his lip under the black moustache,
pointed in military fashion at the ends, and
appeared more annoyed than he need because a
pretty girl had insisted upon having her own way.</p>

<p>It was not yet cold, as he had prophesied, but
it was many degrees cooler than in the sunshine;
and as they rode on the valley narrowed, the soft
darkness of the olive grove closing in the white
road that overhung the rock-bed of the river.</p>

<p>The hills rose higher, shutting out the day,
and there was a brooding silence, only intensified
by the hushed whisper of the water among
its pebbles.</p>

<p>The shoulders of the heights were losing their
gold glitter now; and Virginia had a curious
sensation of leaving reality behind and entering
a mysterious dreamland.</p>

<p>For a long time they rode without speaking.
Then Virginia broke the spell of constraint which
had fallen upon them.</p>

<p>"Where are the persons who gather the
olives?" she asked of the Italian, who rode
almost sullenly beside her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"This isn't the time of year for that," he
replied, more abruptly than was his custom
in speaking to her.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a deserted place!" exclaimed
the girl. "We have ridden ever so far
into the valley now&mdash;two miles at least&mdash;and
there hasn't been a sign of human habitation;
not a person, not a house, except the little
ruined tower we passed a few minutes ago, and
that old ch&acirc;teau almost at the top of the hill.
Look! the last rays of the sun are touching its
windows before saying good-bye to the valley.
Aren't they like the fiery eyes of some fierce animal
glaring watchfully down at us out of the dusk?"</p>

<p>Pointing upward, she turned to him for approval
of her fancy, and to her surprise saw him
pale, as if he had been attacked with sudden
illness.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he replied. "A slight
chill, perhaps."</p>

<p>"No, there is more than that," Virginia said
slowly. "I'm sure of it. I've been sure ever
since we stood on the bridge looking up this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
valley. You wanted to go on. You could
hardly bear to stop, and when I proposed riding
in you made excuses."</p>

<p>"Only for your sake, fearing you might catch
cold."</p>

<p>"Yet you suggested going on to another
valley. Would it have been warmer than this?
Oh, Marchese, I don't like you when you are
subtle and secretive. It reminds me that we
are of different countries&mdash;as different as
the north can be from the south. Do tell me
what is really in your mind. Why do you
hate this valley? Why has coming into it tied
your tongue, and made you look as if you had
seen a ghost?"</p>

<p>"You exaggerate, Miss Beverly," said Loria.
"But if you care to know the precise truth you
shall, on one condition."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That you turn your horse's head and consent
to go out into the sunshine again. When
we are there I will tell you."</p>

<p>"No. If I hear your story, and think it worth
turning back for, I will. I mean to have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
nearer glimpse of that ch&acirc;teau. It must have
a lovely view over the tops of the olive trees."</p>

<p>She touched the mare, who changed from a
trot into a gallop. In five minutes more they
would be under the castle; but almost instantly
Loria, obliged to follow, had caught up with
her again.</p>

<p>"One of the greatest sorrows of my life is
connected with this valley," he answered desperately.
"Now will you take pity upon me
and turn round?"</p>

<p>Virginia hesitated. The man's voice shook.
She did not know whether to yield or to feel
contempt because he showed emotion so much
more readily than her English and American
friends. But while she hesitated they were
joined by her cousin, Sir Roger Broom, who
had been riding behind with her half-brother,
George Trent, and Lady Gardiner.</p>

<p>"Look here, Loria," he exclaimed, with a
certain excitement underlying his tone; "it has
just occurred to me that this is&mdash;er&mdash;the
place that's been nicknamed for the last few
years the 'Valley of the Shadow.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right," answered Loria. "That
is why I didn't wish to come in."</p>

<p>Sir Roger nodded toward the ch&acirc;teau, which
now loomed over them, gray, desolate, one half
in ruins, yet picturesquely beautiful both in
position and architecture. "Then that is&mdash;&mdash;"
he began, but the Italian cut him short.</p>

<p>"Yes. And won't you help me persuade Miss
Beverly that we've seen enough of this valley
now?"</p>

<p>"Why, the castle's for <i>sale</i>!" cried Virginia
suddenly, before Roger Broom had had time to
speak.</p>

<p>She pointed to one of the tall gate-posts at the
foot of the hill, close to the road, which showed
a notice-board announcing in both French and
Italian that the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche was to be
sold, permission to view being obtainable within.</p>

<p>"Poor people; they must have been reduced
to sad straits indeed!" murmured Sir Roger,
looking at the board with its faded lettering,
half defaced by time and weather.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was all very unfortunate, very miserable,"
Loria said hastily. "Shall we go back?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The Englishman seemed hardly to hear. "I'd
seen photographs of the valley, but I'd quite
forgotten, until suddenly it began to look familiar.
Then, all in a flash, I remembered."</p>

<p>"What do you remember; and why do you
call this the Valley of the Shadow?" demanded
Virginia. "You are both very mysterious. But
perhaps it's the influence of the place. Everything
seems mysterious here."</p>

<p>Roger Broom sighed, and roused himself with
an effort from his reverie. "Queer that we
should have drifted here by accident," he said&mdash;"especially
with <i>you</i>, Loria."</p>

<p>"Why especially with me?" the other asked
with a certain sharpness.</p>

<p>"You were the poor fellow's friend. Oh,
Virginia, forgive me for not answering you.
This place is reminiscent of tragedy. A man
whom I used to know slightly, and Loria intimately,
lived here. That grim old house perched
up on the hillside has been the home of his
ancestors for hundreds of years. Now, you see,
it is for sale. But it's likely to remain so.
Who would buy it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Virginia. "Is it haunted?"</p>

<p>"Only by melancholy thoughts of a family
ruined, a man cut off from life at its best and
brightest, to be sent into exile worse than death.
By the way, Loria, do you know what became
of the sister?"</p>

<p>"I have heard that she still lives here with
an aunt and one old servant," answered the
Italian, his face gray-white in the greenish dusk
of the olive woods.</p>

<p>"Is it possible? What a life for a girl! I
suppose that there is absolutely not money
enough to keep up another establishment, no
matter how small. Why, were there no relatives&mdash;no
one to help?"</p>

<p>"The relatives all believed in her brother's
guilt, and she would have nothing to do with
them. As for help, her family is a difficult one
to help. Of course it would be a good thing
for her to sell the ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>Virginia sat her horse between the two others,
impatient and curious. It was easy to see how
distasteful the conversation was to the Marchese
Loria. He answered Sir Roger's questions only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
by an effort; and as for her cousin, even he was
moved out of the imperturbable <i>sang-froid</i> which
sometimes pleased, sometimes irritated Virginia,
according to her mood.</p>

<p>"Was it because of this young man's guilt
that the place was called the Valley of the
Shadow?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes. A mere nickname, of course, though
an ominous one," said Roger. "You see, the
Dalahaides used to keep open house, and spend a
great deal of money at one time, so that their
ruin threw a gloom over the country even colder
than the evening shadows. The father took
his own life in shame and despair, the mother
died of grief, and only a girl is left of the four
who used to be so happy together."</p>

<p>"But what of the fourth&mdash;the brother?"
In spite of herself, Virginia's voice sank, and the
penetrating chill of the valley crept into her
spirit.</p>

<p>"He is worse than dead," answered Roger
evasively. "By Jove! Loria is right. It <i>is</i>
cold here. Let us turn back."</p>

<p>"I should like to buy that ch&acirc;teau,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>announced the American girl, as calmly as if
she had spoken of acquiring a new brooch.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! What next?" exclaimed Sir
Roger. "But you're not in earnest, of course."</p>

<p>"I am in earnest," said she. "I should love
to have it. It's an ideal house, set on that great
rocky hill, and ringed round with olive groves.
Though the sun is gone so soon from the bottom
of the valley, where we are, the ch&acirc;teau
windows are still bright. The place fascinates
me. I am going to ride in and ask to see the
house. Who will come with me?"</p>

<p>Virginia looked at the Marchese with a half-smiling
challenge; but he did not speak, and
Lady Gardiner's black eye gave out a flash.
She was as poor as she was handsome and
well-born, and her life as the American girl's
chaperon was an easy one. The thought that
Virginia Beverly might make up her mind to
become the Marchesa Loria was disagreeable to
Kate Gardiner, and she was glad that the
Italian should displease the spoilt beauty.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, dear, if you are really bent
on the adventure," said the elder woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me, Miss Beverly. But I&mdash;once
knew these people. I could not go into their
house on such an errand. They would think I
had come to spy on their misfortune," protested
Loria miserably.</p>

<p>"I knew them too," said Roger Broom,
"and I'll stay down here and keep Loria
company."</p>

<p>Lady Gardiner looked at George Trent, with
whom she was having an amusing flirtation,
which would certainly have been more than
amusing if he had been only a quarter as rich
as his half-sister.</p>

<p>"I'll take you and Virgie up to the door, anyhow,"
he responded to the look, and springing
from his horse, he pushed open the tall gate of
rusty iron.</p>

<p>Then, mounting again, the three passed
between the gray stone gate-posts with an
ancient carved escutcheon obliterated with moss
and lichen. They rode along the grass-grown
avenue which wound up the hill among the
cypresses and olive trees, coming out at last, as
they neared the ch&acirc;teau, from shadow into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
pale, chastened sunshine which among the
gray-green trees had somewhat the effect of
moonlight.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of the Dalahaides?"
Virginia demanded of her chaperon.</p>

<p>"If I have, I've forgotten," said Lady Gardiner.
"And yet there does seem to be a dim
memory of something strange hovering at the
back of my brain."</p>

<p>They were above the grove now, on a terrace
with a perspective of ruined garden, whence
the battered faces of ancient statues peeped out,
yellow-white from behind overgrown rose bushes
and heliotrope. The ch&acirc;teau was before them,
the windows still reflecting the sunlight; but
this borrowed glitter was all the brightness it had.
Once beautiful, the old battlemented house had
an air of proud desolation, as if scorning pity,
since it could no longer win admiration.</p>

<p>"You would have to spend thousands of
pounds in restoring this old ruin if you should
really buy it, Virginia," said Lady Gardiner.</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't it be worth while to spend
them?" asked the girl. "I certainly&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
She stopped in the midst of her sentence, a
bright flush springing to her face; for turning
a corner of the avenue which brought them close
to the ch&acirc;teau, they came suddenly upon a
young woman, dressed in black, who must have
heard their last words.</p>

<p>Instantly George Trent had his hat in his
hand, and before Virginia could speak he had
dismounted and plunged into explanations.
He begged pardon for the intrusion, and said
that, as they had seen the announcement that
the ch&acirc;teau was for sale, they had ventured to
ride up in the hope of being allowed to see
the house. As he spoke, in fairly good though
rather laboured French, he smiled on the girl
in black with a charming smile, very like Virginia's.
And Lady Gardiner looked from one to
the other gravely. She was not as pleased as
she had been that George Trent had come here
with them, for the girl in the shabby black
dress had a curiously arresting, if not beautiful
face, and her surroundings, the background of
the desolate castle, and the circumstances of
the meeting, framed her in romance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Gardiner did not like the alacrity with
which Trent had snatched off his hat and
sprung from his horse, nor did she approve of
the expression in his eyes, though Virginia's
were just as eager.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all three, the girl answered
in English; not the English of a French <i>jeune
fille</i>, instructed by an imported "Miss," but the
English of an Englishwoman, pure and sweet,
though the voice was sad and lifeless. Her
melancholy dark eyes, deep and sombre as
mountain tarns, wandered from the brother's
handsome face to the beautiful one of the sister.</p>

<p>"Pray don't speak of an intrusion," she said.
"Our servant will be glad to show you through the
house, and afterward, if you really think of buying
the place, he will give you the address of an
agent in Mentone who can tell you everything."</p>

<p>"Then shan't we find you again when we have
seen the ch&acirc;teau?" asked Virginia wistfully.</p>

<p>The girl smiled for the first time, but there was
no brightness in the smile. "I shall be very
pleased to speak with you before you go if there
is anything you care to say to me," she replied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
mechanically raising the great bunch of heliotrope
she had been gathering to her lips.</p>

<p>"Now I will call our servant. He will put up
your horses while you go in; though I'm afraid
that we have no very good accommodation for
them, as our stables have been empty for a long
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, we needn't give him that
trouble," said Trent. "I can fasten the horses'
bridles to some tree or other, and they will be
all right."</p>

<p>The girl disappeared, a slender, youthful
figure in the plain black gown, yet her step,
though it was not slow, had none of the lithsomeness
of youth. She seemed to have lost
all joy of life, though she could scarcely have
been more than twenty-two or three.</p>

<p>"Another mystery!" Virginia said in a low
voice. "How comes she to be English? Is she
the girl they were talking about down below,
or is she a companion?"</p>

<p>"She looks like a banished princess," said
Trent. "I never saw such wonderful eyes.
Deep as a well, reflecting a night of stars."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Gardiner's lips tightened a little. She
was rather vain of her eyes. "I think the girl
would appear a very ordinary young person,"
she remarked, "if one saw her anywhere but
here."</p>

<p>George lifted her down from the horse without
answering, but Virginia did not wait to be
helped. She sprang to the ground, and by the
time that George had tethered the horses an old
man in a faded livery came limping out from
the side door through which the girl in black
had lately disappeared.</p>

<p>Almost crippled with rheumatism, he had
still all the dignity of a trusted servant of an
ancient house, and his old eyes seemed gravely
to defy these prosperous young people to criticize
his threadbare clothing.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle" had desired him to take
monsieur and mesdames over the ch&acirc;teau, he
politely announced in French, and went on to
beg that they would give themselves the trouble
of being conducted to the door at the front, that
they might go in by the great hall. He also
regretted that the visitors had not arrived earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in the day, as the rooms could not be seen at
their best advantage so near to sunset.</p>

<p>Virginia's heart began to beat oddly as she
entered the house. She had still the feeling of
having left realities behind and strayed into
dreamland; but with the opening of the heavy
door it seemed to her that the dream was about
to change into a vision which would mean something
for her future.</p>

<p>Of course it was all nonsense, she told herself,
as the old man led them across the shadowy,
tapestry-hung hall, and from one huge, dim,
wainscotted or frescoed room to another; yet
always, as they approached a doorway, she
caught herself thinking&mdash;"Now a strange
thing is going to happen."</p>

<p>"This is the state drawing-room; this is the
library; this is the chapel; this is the bride's
suite," the servant announced laconically. But
though the castle was evidently very ancient
and must have a private history of its own, centuries
old, he offered no garrulous details of
past grandeur, as most servants would. As
they walked through a dining-room of magnif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>icent
proportions, but meagrely furnished, they
passed a half-open door, and Virginia had a
glimpse of a charming little room with a huge
projecting window. Mechanically she paused,
then drew away quickly as she saw that mademoiselle
was seated at a table arranging the
flowers she had gathered in the melancholy garden.
The old man hobbled on, as if the door had
not existed, and Virginia would have followed,
had not the girl in black stepped forward and
invited them in, with a certain proud humility.</p>

<p>"This is our sitting-room&mdash;my aunt's and
mine," she said. "My aunt is not here now,
so come in, if you will. It is a small room;
still, it is one of the brightest and most home-like
we have left."</p>

<p>She held open the door, and the three visitors
obeyed her gesture of invitation; but suddenly
the girl's face changed. The blood streamed
up to her forehead, then ebbed again, leaving
her marble-pale. She gave a slight start, as
if she would have changed her mind and kept
the strangers from entering; yet she made no
motion to arrest them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has just remembered something in this
room that she doesn't wish us to see," thought
Virginia; but it was too late to retreat, without
drawing attention to an act which she could not
explain. They all went in, the others apparently
suspecting nothing; but in a second Virginia
instinctively guessed the reason of her
hostess's sudden constraint, and the sympathetic
thrill that ran through her own veins
surprised her. In a panel of the darkly wainscotted
and curiously gilded wall was placed
a life-size portrait of a man. It was an oil-painting,
defective in technique, perhaps, but
so spirited, so extraordinarily lifelike as to
give an effect, at first glance in the twilight, as if
a handsome young man were just stepping in
through an open door. Virginia seemed to
meet the brilliant, audacious eyes; the frank,
almost boyish smile was for her; and&mdash;whether
because of the half-told story of this strange
house, or because of the brave young splendour
of the figure in the portrait&mdash;her heart
gave a bound such as it had never yet given for
a man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not need to be told that this was the
counterfeit presentment of him who, in some
mysterious way, had brought ruin upon those
who loved him; and suddenly she understood
the full meaning of Loria's words when he had
said, "The relatives all believed in his guilt, so
his sister would have nothing to do with them."</p>

<p>Virginia Beverly, headstrong, wilful, passionate,
was only superficially spoilt by the flattery
which had been her daily diet as a great beauty
and a great heiress. She was impulsive, but
her impulses were true and often unselfish.
Now her warm heart went out to meet the loyal
heart of the pale, sad girl in black, whom an
hour ago she had never seen, whose very name
she had not known. "She is right to believe
in him," Virginia said to herself. "Loyalty is
the finest virtue of all. I believe in him too.
Whatever crime they say he committed, I'm
sure he was innocent. What&mdash;a criminal,
with that face? It's not possible, and I wish
I could tell her so."</p>

<p>She could scarcely tear her eyes from the
portrait, though she feared to let her interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
be observed, lest it should unjustly be put down
to vulgar curiosity. And when the old man who
conducted them, having met and answered a
quick glance from his mistress, invited the
visitors to continue their tour of inspection,
Virginia left her thoughts behind in the room
of the portrait, walking as in a dream through
the series of lofty, half-dismantled apartments
which still remained to be visited.</p>

<p>She hoped that, when they should see their
hostess again for the promised leave-taking, it
would be in the same room as before. But she
was doomed to disappointment. Mademoiselle
met the party in the great hall, and, hearing
from George Trent that his sister thought seriously
of buying the ch&acirc;teau, gave them the
address of an estate agent in Mentone.</p>

<p>Virginia was not a self-centred girl, and at
any other time she would have been surprised at
the encouragement given to this new whim of
hers by her half-brother; she would have sought
some underlying cause, for George Trent&mdash;who
was her mother's son by a first marriage&mdash;was
nearly five years older than she, and rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
piqued himself upon influencing her to ways
of wisdom. But now, though he extolled the
charms of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche, and made
light of the expenses of restoration, as they rode
down the avenue under the olive trees, Virginia
was too much occupied with the mystery of
the house and the portrait's original to observe
the young man's manner. It did not escape
Lady Gardiner's observation, however, and
her thoughts were troubled.</p>

<p>She was thirty-six and George Trent was ten
years younger; but she confessed to twenty-nine,
and really did not look more, except when certain
worries, which she usually kept in the background,
pressed heavily upon her. For a year,
ever since Virginia had left America for England
and the Continent, she had lived with the
sister and brother, and had been reaping a harvest
almost literally of gold and diamonds. She
did not want Virginia to marry and free herself
from chaperonage; and if she could not marry
George Trent herself, since he was neither
old enough nor rich enough, she could not bear
the thought that he might forget his passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
admiration for her, and fall seriously in love
with some one else.</p>

<p>She, too, was curious concerning mademoiselle
and her past, but with a very different
curiosity from Virginia's, and she determined
to learn the story of the Dalahaides and their
ch&acirc;teau above the Valley of the Shadow. She
did not, however, wish to appear curious before
Virginia or her brother, and hoped that the American
girl, with her wonted audacity, would at
once approach the topic when they had rejoined
Sir Roger Broom and the Marchese Loria.
But Virginia asked no questions, contenting herself
with answering those of her cousin, which
for some reason confined themselves entirely to
the ch&acirc;teau. Lady Gardiner was sure, since
he admitted having known the Dalahaides, that,
being human, Roger would have liked to hear
something of the girl who lived there like Mariana
in the Moated Grange; and it would have
been interesting to know why he refrained from
mentioning her.</p>

<p>As they rode through the valley, dark and sad
now, in the chill of its early dusk, she brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
her horse to Virginia's side in so narrow a defile
of the road that Roger, who was with the girl,
dropped behind.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed that the Marchese hasn't
asked us a single question about your ch&acirc;teau?"
she remarked. "He is a changed man since we
came into this valley. I wonder if there was ever
anything between him and that tragic-looking
girl up there? Perhaps Sir Roger knows, and
that's the reason he didn't speak of her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," echoed Virginia listlessly, and
Kate Gardiner said no more.</p>

<p>An odd restraint seemed to have settled on
the whole party, which had started out so gaily
in the sunshine. Each one was sunk deep in
his or her own thoughts, as if the twilight had
touched them with its delicate melancholy.</p>

<p>They were stopping at the Cap Martin hotel,
high on the hill in its beautiful garden, and
among its pines; and there was a dance that
night, for which Virginia had promised Loria
several waltzes; but she complained that the
ride had tired her.</p>

<p>Instead of dancing she went after dinner to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the private sitting-room which she and Lady
Gardiner shared, having quietly asked Roger
Broom if he would come to her there for a few
minutes. He found her, not in the room, but
on the balcony, in floods of moonlight, which
gave her beauty an unearthly charm as she lay
on a <i>chaise longue</i>, wrapped in an evening cloak
of white and silver brocade.</p>

<p>"You don't mind leaving the dance a little
while&mdash;for me?" she asked.</p>

<p>Roger smiled his quiet, pleasant smile.
"There's nothing in the world I would mind
leaving for you, Virginia," he said, "and I
think you know that very well."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I believe it's true. I should like
to believe it to-night," she answered, "because
I need your help. There's a secret, and I must
find it out."</p>

<p>As the girl spoke there was a slight sound in
the room beyond the big, open window.</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed Roger. "Who is
there?"</p>

<p>"Nobody," said Virginia. "It must be a log
of olive-wood falling in the fireplace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE STORY TOLD BY TWO</h3>


<p>Roger waited. He knew that Virginia
was gathering her forces together, and
that he might expect the unexpected.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me all about that girl in
mourning who lives at the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche," she said after a moment; "and what
her brother did."</p>

<p>Roger was slow in answering. "It's not a
pleasant story for your ears. I was sorry this
afternoon that I had spoken even as freely
as I did about it before you. Loria took
me to task rather, after you'd gone up to
the ch&acirc;teau, and he was right. By Jove!
Virginia, I believe that if I'd said nothing,
the idea of buying the place would never have
occurred to you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," she admitted. "But it <i>has</i>
occurred to me, and once I have an idea in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
head I keep it tenaciously&mdash;as all my long-suffering
friends know to their sorrow. Will you
go to-morrow to the agent whose address I have
and make inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think if no one thwarts me, I'll get
over the fancy. But I won't! I'm going to have
that ch&acirc;teau among the olive trees for mine if it
costs me fifty thousand pounds (which it won't,
I know), even if I only live in it for one month
out of five years. The thing is, to feel it's my
own. So now, you see, as the place is practically
my property, naturally I'd like to know something
of the people who have been its owners."</p>

<p>"I don't see why. When one buys a house
one doesn't usually agitate oneself much about
the family history of one's predecessors."</p>

<p>"Roger, you know this is different. I want
you and no one to else tell me. Still, if you
won't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you insist you must be gratified, I
suppose, up to certain limits. What do you
want to know?"</p>

<p>"Everything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm! Rather too large an order, my child.
However, to begin with, the Dalahaides of the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche were English in the last
generation, but the family is of French origin.
When the last member of the French branch
died, a banker in London was the next heir.
He gave the ch&acirc;teau and the Dalahaide house
in Paris as a wedding present to his son, who
was about to be married. The bride and
bridegroom came over on their honeymoon,
and took such a fancy to the ch&acirc;teau
that they made their home there, or rather
between it and the old house in Paris. This
young couple had in time a son, and then
a daughter. Perhaps you saw the daughter
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was she. You didn't ask me about
her before."</p>

<p>"No; the fact is, I thought that further conversation
on the subject would be too painful
for poor Loria. You must have seen that he
was upset."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help seeing. But go on."</p>

<p>"Well, the father and mother and their two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
children were a most devoted family. They
were all handsome and clever and popular, and
if they were not millionaires, they were extravagant,
for they gave delightful entertainments
here and in Paris, and their purses were open
for any one who wished to dip in his fingers.</p>

<p>"The son Maxime, always called Max, inherited
his father's generous, reckless, extravagant
ways. He was drawn into the fastest
set in Paris, and lost a lot of money at baccarat.
That wouldn't have mattered much, perhaps, if
at the same time some large investments of the
father's hadn't gone wrong and crippled the
family resources. Then, as misfortunes generally
come in crowds, there was a slight earthquake
along this part of the coast, and the
ch&acirc;teau was partly ruined, as you saw to-day,
for they were not able then to have it restored.
'Next year,' they said; but there was no next
year for the Dalahaides. Only a few months
after the first two blows came the third, which
was to crush the family for ever. Max Dalahaide
was accused of murder, tried, and condemned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"What&mdash;he is <i>dead</i>, then? I thought you
said&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" Virginia's heart gave so sudden
and violent a bound that she stammered,
and grew red and white under the revealing
moonlight. She was thinking of the portrait&mdash;seeing
it again, looking into the eyes which
had seemed to speak. Dead! Executed as
a murderer! The thought was horrible; it
stifled her.</p>

<p>"No, he is not dead," answered Roger
gravely; "at least, if he is I haven't heard of it.
But&mdash;if he still exists&mdash;one can't call it living&mdash;he
must have wished a hundred times a day
to die and be out of his misery. Perhaps death
has come to him. It might, and I not have
known; for from out of the pit which has
engulfed him, seldom an echo reaches the world
above."</p>

<p>"Roger, you frighten me! What do you
mean?" the girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, child. I forgot for a moment,
and was thinking aloud. I don't often forget
you, do I? I said to-day that Max Dalahaide was
dead in life. That is true. Family influence, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
tremendous eloquence of a man engaged to plead
his cause, the fact that Max insisted upon his
innocence, while the evidence was entirely circumstantial,
saved him from the guillotine,
which I believe he would have preferred, in his
desperation. He was sent to that Hades upon
earth, New Caledonia, a prisoner for life."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;he was <i>English</i>!"</p>

<p>"No. His parents had been English, but he,
having been born in France, was a French subject.
He had even served his time in the army.
Naturally he was amenable to French law; and
he is buried alive in Noumea, the most terrible
prison in the world."</p>

<p>"And he was innocent!"</p>

<p>Roger, who had been gazing out over the sea,
turned a surprised look upon Virginia.</p>

<p>"No! He was not innocent," he said quickly.
"Everything proved his guilt. It is impossible
that he should have been innocent."</p>

<p>"His sister believed in him."</p>

<p>"Yes, his sister. What does that prove?
The father thought him guilty, and killed himself.
As for the mother&mdash;who knows? At all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
events, she died&mdash;broken-hearted. Every
penny the family possessed, after their great
losses, went for Maxime's defense; but, except
that his life was saved, it was in vain."</p>

<p>"You knew him&mdash;he was your friend&mdash;yet
you believed in his guilt?"</p>

<p>"I hardly knew him well enough to call myself
a friend. I admired him, certainly Max
Dalahaide was the handsomest, wittiest, most
fascinating fellow I ever met. Neither man
nor woman could resist him, if he set out to
conquer. Loria and he were like brothers; yet
Loria thought with the rest of the world. He
can't be blamed for disloyalty, either, for really
there was nothing else to think, if one used one's
reason."</p>

<p>"If he had been <i>my</i> friend, I would not have
used my reason!" exclaimed Virginia. "What
is the use of reason, when one has instinct?&mdash;and
that is never wrong. But it is good of you
to defend the Marchese, for I know you don't
like him."</p>

<p>"Don't I?" echoed Roger. "If I don't, I'm
afraid it is because you <i>do</i>. You won't have me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
dear; you've told me that, and I don't mean to
bother you again; but I'm weak enough to be
jealous when I think there's danger of your
saying 'Yes' to anybody else."</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is any such danger
in this case," said Virginia. "But the Marchese
is very handsome, and rather romantic, and he
sings like an angel. Oh, yes, I am almost in
love with him when he sings&mdash;or I was till
yesterday. And how he dances! It's poetry.
When I am waltzing with the Marchese Loria I
invariably make up my mind that I will accept
him next time he asks. Then, afterward, something
holds me back. To-day, in that valley of
shadows, he affected me quite differently. It
was as if&mdash;as if the shadows had shut down
between us. I saw him in the shadow, his
features changed&mdash;repellent. As the French
say, he 'made me horror.' Yet I didn't know
why. Now I begin to understand. It was my
precious instinct warning me, saying: 'This
man is disloyal. Don't trust him.'"</p>

<p>"You are unjust," said Roger. "I should
like to let you misjudge him, but I can't be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a bounder, you know. He really behaved
extremely well in the Dalahaide affair. The
man couldn't believe, against a mountain of
evidence; nevertheless, he did what he could
for his friend, guilty as he thought him. All
this happened four years ago, when you were
a demure little schoolgirl&mdash;if you ever <i>could</i>
have been demure!&mdash;in your own Virginia,
not allowed even to hear of, much less read, the
great newspaper scandals of the moment. I
can't remember every detail of the affair, but
it was said to be largely through Loria's efforts
that Max was saved from capital punishment
for his crime."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me yet what that crime
was."</p>

<p>"Yes. I have said it was murder."</p>

<p>"Ah! but that is only a crude statement. I
ask for the story."</p>

<p>"You won't have it from me, my child," answered
Roger coolly. "I'm not a sensation-monger.
It was a horrid affair, and one
doesn't talk of such things to little girls. You
know all from me that you will know. Buy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
your ch&acirc;teau, if you choose. You've money
enough to squander on twenty such toys and
not miss it. No doubt poor Madeleine Dalahaide
will be benefited by the exchange&mdash;her
castle for your money. Fortunate for her,
perhaps, that she is the last of the French Dalahaides,
and has the right to sell the ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>"You will tell me nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell <i>you</i> one thing. I believe
that the man was innocent. I have seen his
portrait. I have seen his sister. That is
enough for me. But what you will not tell me
I shall learn for myself, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;you
shall see what you shall see."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Virginia slept restlessly that night. In her
dreams she was always in the Valley of the
Shadow, striving to find her way out into the
sunlight; and sometimes the valley seemed but
the entrance to that bottomless pit of shame
where Maxime Dalahaide was entombed. She
awoke from a dream forgotten, in a spasm of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
cold fear, before it was dawn, and switching on
the electric light near the bed, she drew her
watch from under the pillow. It was just six
o'clock; and for a few moments Virginia lay
still, thinking over the events of yesterday.
After all, what did they mean for her? Nothing,
said Reason; everything, said a Voice
to which she could give no name.</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart began to beat quickly
with the excitement of a strange thought that
seemed to spring out of herself, and then turn
to face her. It pushed the girl from her bed,
and she rose, shivering; for even here at Cap
Martin it was cold in the early morning before
the vivid sun had warmed the air.</p>

<p>She was used to lying in bed until a fire of
fragrant pine cones and olive wood crackled
on the hearth, and her own maid had filled the
bath in the bathroom adjoining. But now
she bathed in the cold, dressing herself in her
riding-habit, and even arranging her hair without
help. By seven her toilet was made, and,
turning off the electric light, she found that the
sky was pink and golden with the winter sunrise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl rang for coffee, and ordered her horse
to be ready. She and Kate Gardiner never
met before ten o'clock, at earliest; thus three
hours would pass before any one save her maid
would begin to wonder where she was; and for
the maid she would leave a line of explanation,
mentioning that she had gone out on
business, and that nothing was to be said
unless Lady Gardiner inquired.</p>

<p>Virginia had a ride of nearly two hours before
she could reach the destination she had planned;
but neither the fresh air, the beauty of the scene,
nor the exercise which she loved, could calm the
fever in her blood. It was as if some power
stronger than herself pushed her on; and though
she had always been too healthy in mind and
body to suffer from superstition, she now believed,
half fearfully, that such an influence
had possession of her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with me?" she asked.
"I am no longer myself. It is as if I were only
an instrument in hands that use me as they
will. Why do I go this morning to the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Roche? I don't know. I don't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
what I shall say to excuse myself when I am
there. Yet, somehow, the words will come
to me&mdash;I feel it."</p>

<p>For it was to the ch&acirc;teau above the Valley
of the Shadow that she was going.</p>

<p>When she reached the gates, half-way up the
slope of the wooded hill which the whole party
had climbed together yesterday, suddenly the
nervous exaltation that had carried her courageously
so far, broke like a violin string too tightly
drawn. She was horrified at her own boldness.
She half turned back; then, setting her
lips together, she slipped down from her
saddle and opened the gate.</p>

<p>This morning no slim, black-clad figure moved
among the wilderness of neglected flowers.
Virginia tethered her mare, ascended the two
or three stone steps, and struck the mailed glove
of iron which formed the knocker on the oak of
the door. Its echoes went reverberating through
wide, empty spaces, and for some moments she
stood trembling at her audacity. She said to
herself that she could not knock again. If no
one answered the last summons she would take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
it as a sign that she ought not to have come, and
she would steal away. But just as the limit of
time she mentally set had passed, and she was
in the act of turning from the door, it opened.</p>

<p>The servant who had guided Virginia and her
friends through the house the day before appeared,
his pale, dignified old face showing such
evident signs of surprise that the American girl,
who had never flinched before any one or anything,
stammered and blushed as she asked for
Mademoiselle Dalahaide.</p>

<p>The old man politely ushered her in, but
he was unable to hide his embarrassment.
Mademoiselle should be informed at once, if
she were at home, but, in fact, it was possible&mdash;&mdash; He
hesitated, and Virginia saw well
that he prepared a way of escape for his young
mistress in case she wished to avoid the unexpected
caller.</p>

<p>"Pray tell mademoiselle that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
Virginia began. She had meant to finish by
saying that her business was urgent. But&mdash;supposing
when she found herself face to face
with the girl in black, the fugitive desires which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had dragged her here refused to be clothed in
coherent words?</p>

<p>As the servant waited respectfully for the end
of the message, a door which Virginia remembered
as leading into the family chapel suddenly
opened. Mademoiselle Dalahaide came
slowly out, her head bent, her long black dress
sweeping the stone floor of the hall in sombre
folds. She did not see the stranger at first;
but a faint ejaculation from the lips of the old
Frenchman caused the dark head to be quickly
raised.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two girls met. Mademoiselle
Dalahaide drew back a little, her tragically
arresting face unlighted by a smile. She
looked the question that she did not speak;
but she gave the American no greeting, and
there was something of displeasure or distrust
in her level, searching look.</p>

<p>The moment which Virginia had dreaded,
yet sought for, had come. All self-consciousness
left her. She went to meet the other in
an eager, almost childlike way.</p>

<p>"Do forgive me," she said in English. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
had to come. I could not sleep last night. I got
up before any one else was awake, because I&mdash;because
I wanted so much to see you, that
I couldn't wait: and I wanted to come to you
alone."</p>

<p>Madeleine Dalahaide's faint frown relaxed.
Virginia in that mood was irresistible, even to a
woman. Still the girl in black did not smile.
She had almost forgotten that it was necessary
and polite to force a smile for strangers. She
had been so much alone, she and sorrow had
grown so intimate, that she had become almost
primitively sincere. The ordinary, pleasant
little hypocrisies of the society in which she
had once lived during what now seemed another
state of existence, no longer existed for her.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was not discourteous.
"You are kind to have taken this trouble,"
she said. "It is something about the ch&acirc;teau,
no doubt&mdash;some questions which perhaps you
forgot to ask yesterday?"</p>

<p>The old man, who understood not a word of
English, had discreetly and noiselessly retired,
now that fate had taken the management of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
situation from his hands. The two girls were
alone in the great hall, the chapel door still open
behind Madeleine Dalahaide, giving her a
background of red and purple light from a
stained-glass window.</p>

<p>"No," Virginia answered. "If I said that
business about the ch&acirc;teau brought me, it
would be merely an excuse. It would make
things easier for me in beginning, but&mdash;I wish
to say to you only things that are really true.
I came because&mdash;because I want to help you."</p>

<p>The white oval of the other's face was suddenly
suffused with scarlet. The dark head
was lifted on the slender throat.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said coldly. "But I am
not in need of help. If that is your reason for
thinking of buying this house, I beg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is not my reason. What can I say
that you won't misunderstand? There is one
whom you love. Just now you were praying for
him in that chapel. I know it. You were
praying to God to help him, weren't you?
What if I should be an instrument sent you to
be used for that purpose?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The tragic eyes stared at the eager, beautiful
face, dazed and astonished.</p>

<p>Virginia went on, not seeming to choose her
words, but letting them flow as they would.</p>

<p>"I know how you have suffered. It is only a
little while that I have known, but it seems
long, very long. I have seen <i>his</i> portrait, and
partly I came up to tell you this morning
that I believe in his innocence; partly that,
but most of all I came to say that he must
be saved."</p>

<p>"Saved?" echoed Madeleine Dalahaide.
"But that is not possible. Only death can
save him now."</p>

<p>Neither had uttered a name; neither was
aware that it had not been spoken by the other.
For Madeleine always, for Virginia in this hour,
one name rang through the world. There was
no need to give it form. And, strangely,
Madeleine was no longer surprised at Virginia's
mission. Perhaps, indeed, she believed her
an incarnate answer to prayer; and in a moment
all conventionalities had crumbled to pieces
at their feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" cried the American
girl. "Prisoners are released sometimes."</p>

<p>"Not life-prisoners at Noumea," replied the
other; and the answer fell desolately on Virginia's
ear. Yet the thought, lit into life by her own
words, as a flame is lighted by striking a match,
had given her courage which would not die.</p>

<p>"Then he will be the first," she said. "I
have been thinking. Oh! it has all been very
vague&mdash;a kind of dream. But now I see
everything clearly. Time unravels mysteries
not easily solved at first. His innocence must
be proved. Powerful friends shall give all
their thoughts, all their ingenuity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have no friends," Madeleine answered
bitterly.</p>

<p>"You have one friend. You have me."</p>

<p>Then at last a sense of the strangeness of this
scene rushed in a wave over the consciousness of
the lonely dweller in the castle.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she said slowly. "Yesterday
we had never met. I only knew your
name because you spoke of buying this poor,
sad home of mine. I&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither do I understand," broke in Virginia.
"But I have never understood myself.
I only know that this seems to be the thing I was
born for. And if I fail in what I want to do
for you and yours, why, I shall have come into
the world for nothing, that is all."</p>

<p>"But you are wonderful!" exclaimed Madeleine
Dalahaide, realizing with sudden force
the other's extreme beauty and strong magnetism.
"Did you&mdash;is it possible that you
ever knew my brother?"</p>

<p>"I never heard his name till yesterday. But
I have seen you, I have seen this house, I have
heard something of the story, and&mdash;I have
seen his portrait. Nobody told me, of course,
that it was his; nobody could. But I knew at
once. And I wondered how any one who had ever
known him could have believed that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid to say it. Believed that
he was a murderer. Oh, friends&mdash;<i>friends</i>!
Friendship is a flower that withers with the
first frost."</p>

<p>"You shan't have cause to think that of me&mdash;if
you are going to take me for a friend."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall thank heaven for you. Even if
you can do nothing, to think that there is one
human being in the world besides my poor
aunt and me who believe in him, is like balm
on an open wound. Come with me into the
room where you saw the portrait. I painted it
the year before&mdash;the end. I talk to it sometimes,
and for a moment I almost forget the
horrible truth&mdash;when the eyes smile back at
me just as they used to do when we had some
joke together."</p>

<p>"As they will again," finished Virginia.</p>

<p>They went into the room of the portrait and
stood before it in silence. Each one felt that
its look was for her.</p>

<p>"And yet," Madeleine said, as if answering a
question, "there must be some one who thinks
of us, and remembers us with kindness, giving
<i>him</i> at least the benefit of a doubt; some one
who talked to you of Max and told you the
story of&mdash;of his so-called crime in such a way
as not to fill your mind with horror."</p>

<p>"No one has told me the story yet," hesitated
Virginia. "I have only heard hints.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
They said&mdash;the word&mdash;<i>murder</i>! But that is
not the face of a murderer. How could any
one believe it?"</p>

<p>"You don't know&mdash;the story?"</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head.</p>

<p>"When you know it, you will turn away from
us, as every one else has."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Be sure I will not."</p>

<p>"How can I be sure? Ah, almost all the
solace of hope has gone now! You will hear
the horrible details, and&mdash;that will be the end."</p>

<p>Virginia caught the slender, cold fingers that
twisted together nervously. "Tell me yourself,"
she cried. "Tell me all&mdash;you, his
sister. Then you will see how I shall bear it,
and whether I shall fail you."</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>Madeleine Dalahaide's breath came unevenly.
For a moment she could not speak. Then she
began, her eyes not on Virginia, but on the
portrait.</p>

<p>"There was a woman," she said in a low,
choked voice. "She was an actress. Max
was in love with her, or thought he was. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was handsome. I have seen her on the stage.
Other men besides Max were mad about her.
But she seemed to care for him. He wanted
to marry her, and when father and mother
didn't approve, he quarrelled with them, for
the first time in his life. We had always been
so happy before that&mdash;so united. Everything
began to go wrong with my poor Max
then. He played cards at his club, and lost
a great deal of money. And as if that were not
enough, father's losses came. He could do
nothing for Max. Besides, the woman Max
loved made him jealous. He suspected that
she cared for somebody else. He told me that
the last time I saw him before&mdash;the terrible
thing happened. But he didn't tell the man's
name. Perhaps he didn't know him. We
had a long talk, for I had been his friend and
confidante through all. I didn't want him to
marry the woman; but even that would be
better than to have him miserable, as he said
he must be without her. And it was the next
night that the murder was committed. But it
was not known until the day after."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;the man of whom he was jealous
who was murdered?"</p>

<p>"No, the woman, Liane Devereux. She had
been shot&mdash;in the face. Oh, it was horrible!
It is horrible now to talk to you of it. Her
features were so destroyed that she could be
recognized only by her hair, which was golden-red,
and her figure&mdash;her beautiful figure which
all the world admired so much. Even her
hands&mdash;she must have held them up before
her face, the poor creature, instinctively trying
to save herself, to preserve her beauty, for
they, too, were shattered. Her jewels were all
gone, and she had had many jewels. Soon the
police discovered that they had been pawned.
And Max was accused of pawning them, to get
money to pay gambling debts."</p>

<p>"How could they accuse him of that?"</p>

<p>"He really had pawned them, at her request.
She wanted money, and would not listen to his
objections to getting it in that way. He had
pawned them on the day of the murder, and
still had the tickets, which he had forgotten to
enclose with the money for the jewels, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sent it to Mademoiselle Devereux. She had
asked him to pawn the things in his name, so
that hers could be protected, and, of course,
that went dreadfully against Max. He couldn't
possibly prove, when the woman was dead,
that he had pawned the jewels for her, because
the money he had raised had disappeared. He
would have taken it to her himself, but on
returning to his own flat from the pawnbroker's
he received a strange letter saying that she
hated him, and never wished to see him again.
It was all quite sudden, and Max was angry.
Still, he might have gone, insisting that she
should tell him what she meant by such a letter,
but he had arranged a hurried journey to England.
They arrested him on the way. He
was going there in the hope of borrowing some
money from his godfather, a cousin of ours,
who had told Max that if at any time he should
be in difficulties he must apply to him. But
what proof had Max of his own intentions?
Every one thought that he was escaping to
England to hide himself, after having committed
a cowardly murder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"There were other bits of evidence against
him, too; for instance, the revolver with which
the woman was shot was his, with a silver monogram
on it. Everybody&mdash;even the best of his
friends&mdash;believed him guilty. And father&mdash;poor
father!&mdash;but I can't talk about that part.
It is too cruel. Oh, you are pale, and changed!
I knew it would be so. You are like the rest.
But how could I expect anything else when you
have heard such a story? Everything against
him&mdash;nothing in his favour. Even Max himself
was dazed. Over and over again he
said that he had no explanation to give of the
mystery."</p>

<p>"There is only one explanation, since he was
innocent&mdash;and I'm as sure of that as before,"
said Virginia firmly. "It was a diabolically
clever plot, planned with fiendish ingenuity,
to ruin your brother&mdash;all your family, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Hundreds of times I have thought of that,"
sighed Madeleine Dalahaide. "Many, many
times I spoke of it to the man who defended
Max at his trial. But there was no one it
would be reasonable to suspect. We had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
absolutely no enemy. Max had none. Everybody
adored him&mdash;in his happy days."</p>

<p>"The man whom Liane Devereux loved
better than your brother?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you must see, as the advocate saw,
that if she loved the other better he had no
motive either to kill the woman or ruin Max.
Where there had been no injury, there need be
no revenge. And if Max knew who the man was
he never told his name."</p>

<p>"There was nobody&mdash;<i>nobody</i> who had a
right to think himself injured by your brother,
even long before?"</p>

<p>"Not by my brother, so far as we could find
out. The theory of a plot was advanced, of
course, and&mdash;and I clung to it; but it fell to the
ground. There seemed nothing to support it."</p>

<p>"And yet, from the way you speak, I can't
help thinking that you suspect some one."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i>! But I am only a woman. I was
a very young girl then. Every one I spoke to&mdash;even
Max&mdash;thought my idea a mad one,
and said it would do our case far more harm
than good to have it mentioned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me, won't you, what it was?"</p>

<p>Madeleine hesitated. "I dare not," she answered.
"My reason says that the thing is
impossible. If I wrong the man, it would be
shameful to create a prejudice in your mind
against one, no doubt a stranger to you, but
whom you might one day meet, and, meeting,
remember my words. Besides, it can do no
good to speak. It would be hopeless to prove
anything against him, even if his hand had
been in a plot."</p>

<p>"Yet you said that your brother had no
enemy?"</p>

<p>"This man was <i>my</i> enemy. It had not always
been so. Once we were friends. But&mdash;something
happened, and afterward I think he hated me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you are speaking of the
Marchese Loria?"</p>

<p>The question sprang from Virginia's lips
before she had stopped to reflect whether it were
wise to ask it, and she was terrified at the effect
of her impulsive words.</p>

<p>Madeleine Dalahaide's pale, sad face became
ashen, her great eyes dilated, and there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
something of fear, perhaps even of distrust, in
the look she turned upon Virginia.</p>

<p>"You know him?" she exclaimed, her voice
suddenly sharp.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the American girl.</p>

<p>"Then I think that you and I cannot be
friends."</p>

<p>"Not friends? But if I give up the Marchese
Loria for you?"</p>

<p>"I do not ask or wish you to do that."</p>

<p>"If he is your enemy he shall not be my
friend."</p>

<p>"I have not said he was my enemy."</p>

<p>"I have heard that he loved your brother
dearly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"And yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of yesterday?"</p>

<p>"He was with us when we rode into the
valley. He turned pale, and begged not to come,
because the place, he said, was connected with
a great sorrow in his life."</p>

<p>"He would not meet me face to face! Did <i>he</i>
suggest that you should try to save my brother?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he did not speak his name before me.
He does not know what is in my mind. No one
knows yet but you. It was my cousin, Roger
Broom, who met you long ago, and told me that
the Marchese Loria had done much to save
your brother's life."</p>

<p>"It may be that he did. I don't deny it.
But if you are to be my friend I ask you this:
say nothing of Maxime Dalahaide to Loria."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A MYSTERY AND A BARGAIN</h3>


<p>Lady Gardiner stood at Virginia's door,
remained for a moment undecided, then
tapped gently. The girl's voice answered "Come
in!" and Kate obeyed.</p>

<p>Virginia sat at a small writing-table in
a window reading a book; but at sight of
Lady Gardiner she snatched up a paper
and hastily laid it over the volume. "Oh,
I thought it was George," she exclaimed,
blushing brilliantly. "He has asked me to
take a walk."</p>

<p>"Now," thought Kate, "what has that book
she's hiding from me to do with the mystery
that's been going on for the past three days?"
but aloud, she said, without appearing to notice
the hurried movement or the tell-tale blush:
"I came to ask if you would go down to town
with me for a little shopping."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't," Virginia answered.
"You see&mdash;er&mdash;I promised George."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wouldn't mind if we arranged for
him to meet us in about an hour; and we might
all three have tea together at Rumpelmayer's."</p>

<p>Virginia looked embarrassed, which was
unusual for her. "We didn't think of going into
Mentone," she said. "We shall just stroll about,
for the fact is, we've business to talk over."</p>

<p>"You seem to have had a great deal of business
to talk over these last few days, you and Mr.
Trent and Sir Roger. Would it be indiscreet to
ask, dear child, if there has been any hitch about
the purchase of your new toy? Oh, don't look
vexed&mdash;your ch&acirc;teau, then?"</p>

<p>"No, there's been no hitch. What made you
think that?"</p>

<p>"Well, business talks are so new for you. A
little while ago you fled from the first hint
of business. But now&mdash;you are very much
changed these last few days, since we went to
the ch&acirc;teau, Virginia. I've been wanting to
speak to you about it. However, you are going
out to walk, and I must wait."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia met her eyes firmly; yet the violet
gaze was not quite as frankly open and childlike
as it used to be. "You needn't wait, if your
shopping can," she said. "Do sit down. I
dare say it may be twenty minutes before George
comes for me. He's with Roger&mdash;somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them. Virginia, do you know,
I've been rather unhappy for several days?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know. I'm very sorry. Is it anything
I've done?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no." Kate did not sit down, but
perched on the arm of a big cushioned chair
between the writing-desk and the dressing-table.
"You see, dear," she went on in her softest
voice, to which she could give a pretty, tearful
<i>tremolo</i> at will, "I'm in rather a peculiar position.
You have been so sweet all this year and more
that we've been together, that I suppose you've
spoilt me. I've forgotten often that I'm only a
paid chaperon, and have felt like a friend and
confidante."</p>

<p>"Why, so you are," returned Virginia.</p>

<p>"Wait, dear; let me finish. I've told you my
various troubles, and you've told me things, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Now, suddenly, everything is changed. Why,
you even sit in your bedroom, instead of in our
sitting-room, or on the balcony with me, as you
used. You don't seem to want my society; you
make excuses if I suggest going anywhere. You
and your brother and cousin are continually getting
away by yourselves and talking in whispers.
Oh, I'm not hurt. It isn't that. I'm not so
thin-skinned and stupid. But I've been thinking
that perhaps I'd offended you, or you
were simply tired of me, and, being kind-hearted,
didn't like to send me about my
business. You know, dear, if you would rather
have any one else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, you <i>are</i> stupid!" cried Virginia.
"Of course I'm not tired of you. We really
have had business&mdash;not about the ch&acirc;teau. I&mdash;didn't
mean to tell you until things were more
settled, but since you've been talking like this,
I will. I've discovered lately that I'm tired of
the Riviera, heavenly as it is here. We've been
a month now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I always told you that Monte Carlo was
more amusing, while as for Cannes&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I've seen enough of the Riviera for
a while."</p>

<p>"What about your ch&acirc;teau, then&mdash;your
ch&acirc;teau in the olive woods that you so adore?"</p>

<p>"That won't be ready until next winter.
There's lots to be done. And&mdash;I've set my
heart on a yachting trip."</p>

<p>Kate Gardiner's face fell. She was a wretched
sailor, and Virginia knew it. Even the crossing
from Dover to Calais was torture to her on a
calm day.</p>

<p>"A <i>long</i> yachting trip?" she asked, controlling
her voice.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know yet. Some weeks, perhaps.
The only difficulty is about you."</p>

<p>Kate did not answer for a moment. <i>Was</i>
this an excuse to get rid of her, and if so, why?
Could it be that Roger Broom had been warning
Virginia that her half-brother was in danger of
making a fool of himself about a woman many
years his senior? A short time ago she might
have believed that this was the explanation, for
Roger Broom knew a good deal about Lady
Gardiner. He was aware that her dead hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>band was
but a city man, knighted when he was
sheriff; that she had been governess to the gruff
old widower's one daughter; that she had
married him for his money, and spent it freely
until what remained was lost in a great financial
panic; that since then she had lived as she
could, trading upon her own aristocratic connections
to chaperon girls, chiefly Americans, who
wished to see "English society from the inside."
Roger knew her real age, or something near it; he
knew that she had been in debt when she had
got this chance with Virginia, to whom she had
been recommended by an American duchess;
and as there was nothing against her character,
he had been too good-natured&mdash;as she would
have expressed it&mdash;to "put a spoke in her
wheel." However, if he suspected designs upon
George, he might not have continued to be as
discreet; but during these last three days
of mysterious confabs, George Trent had
appeared as much changed toward her as his
half-sister had, so that Roger need have had no
new fears for him. George had never ceased
to be courteous, but there was a subtle difference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in his manner, in his way of looking at her. He
appeared preoccupied; he no longer sought her
out. And this alteration had only come about
since the day when they had visited the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Roche.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, it was George who was tired of
her. He had never been the same since he had
seen that girl in black, with the tragic eyes and
the dead-white face, with no more life in it than
a marble statue. Maybe he was planning to
attach that girl to the party in some way, and
would find the society of the woman with whom
he had flirted a constraint.</p>

<p>At this thought Kate Gardiner felt her blood
grow hot. It was unbearable that she should be
sent out of George Trent's life to make room for
a younger woman. She would not have it&mdash;she
would not! If it killed her to go on this hateful
yachting trip she would go; she would not be
whistled down the wind.</p>

<p>"Oh, if the difficulty is only about me,"
she said sweetly, "it needn't be a difficulty
at all. I dare say I shall be ill for a few
days, but it can't last forever. I shall simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
stop in my stateroom until I am fit to lie
in a deck-chair and be a more or less interesting
invalid."</p>

<p>As she spoke she watched Virginia's face
through half-lowered lashes, and was certain that
it changed. There could no longer be any
doubt on that subject. For some reason Virginia
did not want her on the yacht.</p>

<p>"I should hate you to be a martyr," said the
girl uncomfortably. "Roger and I have been
thinking it over, and I was wondering, in case
we went (nothing is actually decided yet),
whether you would like to wait here. I would
keep on your room and the sitting-room, and the
victoria, and you should have my maid and your
own horse. Your income would be the same as
always, of course; and you have a lot of friends
here, so you wouldn't be lonely."</p>

<p>"How sweet and thoughtful you are, dearest
child!" exclaimed Kate gratefully; while within
she was saying, "Oh, so this is the game, is it?
Come now; at least you're showing your hand.
Roger and you have been 'talking things over?'
You seem to have thought out the details pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
well; and I'm to be bribed. But it won't work,
my love, it won't work." She rose, and going to
Virginia, took her hand, looking affectionately
down at the beautiful face. "You are always
ready to sacrifice yourself for me. But what
would you do for a chaperon if I stopped
behind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you see, George and Roger and I would
be all the party on board. Surely George is
chaperon enough?"</p>

<p>"Poor Marchese!" murmured Kate. "I'm
afraid he also is suffering from an eclipse."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Virginia,
her colour deepening. "Why should he expect
an invitation to go with us?"</p>

<p>"Ah! why? Unless, indeed, he had hopes
that he was soon to be given some rights over
you. Only the other day I used to fancy
that you and he were half engaged."</p>

<p>"We never were. I&mdash;I found him rather
interesting. But I don't think I have behaved
very badly. I really meant&mdash;oh, I don't know
<i>what</i> I meant then; but I know I don't mean it
now. The Marchese Loria is the <i>last</i> person I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
should wish to have go on this yachting trip, and
as it's only us three, we'll chaperon each other."</p>

<p>"Can it be that she means to marry Roger
Broom after all?" Kate Gardiner asked herself.
"To my certain knowledge, she's refused him.
I heard him reminding her of it the other night.
But one never knows how many times a girl may
change her mind. The more I think of it the
more determined I am to be of the party on
that yacht."</p>

<p>"Unless I should be one too many, I'd really
love to go," said she aloud. "I must get over my
horror of the sea. Mayn't I be with you, dear, if
you have really made up your mind? I've grown
so fond of you. I should feel deserted here."</p>

<p>"Even for a few weeks?"</p>

<p>"Even for a few weeks. When you marry, or
go home to the States, I must lose you, but do let
me be with you as long as I can."</p>

<p>"You shall go if you really wish to so much,"
said Virginia, trying in vain not to appear constrained.
"Only I warn you, you may find that
you've made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Why, how seriously you speak. One would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
think you meditated a voyage to the North Pole.
Probably, though, you'll simply linger about in
the Mediterranean; go to Naples, Greece, perhaps,
and Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort, I suppose," Virginia
answered, dropping her eyes and playing with the
paper she had used to conceal her book. "It's
rather vague at present. Roger and George are
looking for a yacht. We'll talk of it again later.
I only mentioned it now to show you that we've
really had business. And by the way, Kate, I'd
rather you didn't say anything about it yet to
people outside. It seems like making it of so
much importance and I'd hate being asked three
times a day: 'Well, when do you start on that
yachting trip?'"</p>

<p>"I shall be discreet, never fear," replied Kate,
more sure than ever that some mystery which
she could not fathom hid itself under this new
plan of Virginia's. "And now for something
else I wanted to ask you. Do, like a dear, good
girl, lend me ten pounds. You know how
stupidly hard up I always am. I'll pay it back
in a few days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia was on her feet in an instant and at
the dressing-table, rummaging among scented
laces and pretty odds and ends for the gold-netted
purse with "V. B." on it in brilliants. For a
moment her back was turned, and during that
moment Kate Gardiner, standing close to the
desk which the girl had left noiselessly, raised a
corner of the paper and peeped underneath.
The book which Virginia had been reading lay
open. It was French, and at the top of the page
Kate saw the word "Noumea." She dared
look no longer, but let the paper drop, and had
wheeled round with her back to the desk just as
Virginia found the purse.</p>

<p>"Thank you <i>so</i> much," purred Lady Gardiner,
who knew from experience that Virginia would
beg her not to give back the money, and that,
with a grateful kiss, and perhaps a tear or two,
she would allow herself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>At this instant there came a knock at the door
leading into the sitting-room, which Kate had
left half-open on entering, and George Trent
appeared, looking excited and eager. His eyes
fell upon Virginia, and he began to speak before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he had seen Lady Gardiner, standing at a little
distance and out of his view at the door.</p>

<p>"I say, Virgie," he exclaimed, "the most
ripping piece of luck. We can get hold of a
steam yacht with four cannon&mdash;toys, but fit for
work&mdash;only you'll have to buy, not hire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, a look passing between him
and Virginia, quick as a flash of light, yet not too
quick to be seen by Kate.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the girl. "Well, we'll talk
about it as we walk. Kate's going shopping."
Evidently she intended to change the subject, but
Lady Gardiner was not ready for another.</p>

<p>"Mercy! Are you fitting out as pirates?" she
demanded, laughing.</p>

<p>George Trent flushed with annoyance under
her unsparing eyes, but he smiled carelessly and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean the cannon? They happen to
be there. It wouldn't be worth while to have the
yacht dismantled. I think myself they'd give
distinction. It isn't everybody who goes yachting
in such conditions."</p>

<p>"Indeed, no. I only wish we may have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
chance to use them. Perhaps we may, if we can
get far enough up the Nile. You see, Virginia
has told me of the trip and promised that I may
go. I hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>Of course George said that it would be charming
to have her on board, and he opened the
sitting-room door when she went out, making
the necessary agreeable remarks about her
shopping expedition. But when the door had
closed after Lady Gardiner, and Virginia had
joined him in the sitting-room, he was no longer
smiling.</p>

<p>"So we're to have another passenger, are we?"
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"She <i>says</i> she wants to go, but she may change
her mind. You know what a wretched sailor she
is. Perhaps even after starting she'll think
better of it and beg to be put off at the nearest
port. I had to tell her about the yacht, for she
was so inquisitive concerning the business that
has occupied you and Roger and me for the past
three days. But she has promised not to say
anything outside till she has permission."</p>

<p>"How much does she know?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing at all, except that I'm tired of the
Riviera and want to go yachting somewhere&mdash;almost
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Sure she doesn't suspect?"</p>

<p>"How could she?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose she couldn't. And as far as
I'm concerned, I don't see why we shouldn't
trust her as if she were one of ourselves; a nice,
jolly little woman, with no harm in her. What
motive could she possibly have for blocking our
game?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed? But you know I said so to
Roger, and he vowed he'd have nothing to do
with it if any one knew except you and Madeleine
Dalahaide and me. He wouldn't hear of poor
Kate's being told, though I assured him one
might trust her. It was all I could do to get him
to promise us, anyway."</p>

<p>"How <i>did</i> you get him to, by the by? He
poured whole cataracts of ice-water on the
scheme at first."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose I wheedled."</p>

<p>"Virgie! I'll bet you said you'd marry him if
he'd go in with us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;exactly say I <i>wouldn't</i>."</p>

<p>"Poor old Roger! Shall you be cad enough
to chuck him afterward?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't do that. I shall be so grateful
to him for this, that I shall feel no reward could
be too great for him&mdash;that is, if we <i>succeed</i>.
He is a dear, kind fellow, and I have often made
him unhappy. I've always thought, somehow,
that I should end by marrying him."</p>

<p>"Yet you've refused him three times."</p>

<p>"That was to put off the evil day."</p>

<p>"And you came jolly near accepting Loria."</p>

<p>"Did I really, do you think? It seems so long
ago, I can hardly remember. Anyway, everything
is different now."</p>

<p>"I'm with you there. By Jove, what a funny
world it is! What will Roger say when he
hears that Kate Gardiner is bent on going? If
he consents to her being on board, I don't see
why he should go on refusing to take Miss
Dalahaide."</p>

<p>"That's not the same thing at all. One can
never do things quite secretly. They always
leak out. Already it has got into the papers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
somehow&mdash;I suppose through that stupid agent&mdash;that
I have bought the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche,
and interest has been revived in the Dalahaide
story. It's so unfortunate that people should
begin to talk again just now! And then if, on
top of all this, should come the news that we'd
taken Madeleine Dalahaide off with us on a
mysterious yachting expedition, what would be
said? Roger is quite right."</p>

<p>"It seems cruel that she should be left out
of it."</p>

<p>"It would be more cruel to have her in, and
perhaps ruin everything. She feels that herself
though, of course, it's hard. Still, think how
awful for her if&mdash;we <i>failed</i>! But I will not think
of that. There's no such word as fail!"</p>

<p>"According to Roger, there's no such word as
success. He's absolutely hopeless, and is only
going into the adventure to please you&mdash;to <i>win</i>
you, perhaps. And, by Jove, it <i>will</i> be an
adventure!"</p>

<p>"Tell me about the yacht you've heard of."</p>

<p>They went out together, walking among the
pine trees surrounding the hotel; and meanwhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Kate Gardiner had driven into the bright little
town of Mentone, with its background of mountains,
its foreground of blue-green sea. In the
neighbourhood of the shops, she sent away her
victoria, which was to pick her up at Rumpelmayer's
at five o'clock. She was charmingly
dressed, and had secured ten pounds with which
to buy an exquisite antique Italian watch which
had taken her fancy a day or two before; never
had there been so little need to worry about the
future from a pecuniary point of view; still,
Kate was not happy. She had lost interest in
the watch, lost interest in her shopping expedition
altogether, and was lingering outside the
jeweler's wondering whether she should spend
the ten pounds as she had planned or not, when
a man's voice at her shoulder made her turn. It
was the Marchese Loria; and Lady Gardiner
noticed, as the sun streamed full into his face
when he took his off hat, that he looked sallow
and haggard.</p>

<p>He was staying at the Cap Martin also, but
they had not seen each other that day, and now
it struck Kate that he was surprisingly changed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
since the afternoon when they had so gaily ridden
off to find the Valley of the Shadow. She was
certain that, for some reason which puzzled her
sorely, Loria had completely lost his chance with
Virginia, and because his interests no longer
threatened her own, she felt more friendly
toward him. They both seemed to be rather
left out in the cold, and she found herself suddenly
sympathizing with the Italian.</p>

<p>He was quick to note the unusual cordiality of
her smile, and was curious as to its motive, for
Loria knew that Lady Gardiner was one of the
few women who never act without one; and he
had been fully aware that she did not favour his
cause with Virginia Beverly.</p>

<p>"Has something in this window caught
your fancy?" he inquired, stopping and joining
her.</p>

<p>Kate pointed to a serpent belt, crusted with
diamond scales, emerald-eyed, and having its
open mouth lined with rubies. "Isn't that
lovely?" she asked. "An antique, of course;
everything is in this window. I daren't look at
it. It's far beyond my means."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm thinking of buying it myself," said Loria
calmly. "I mean to give it to a woman I know,
as a little souvenir of my gratitude for very
great kindness."</p>

<p>"Lucky woman!" exclaimed Kate enviously,
for she really wanted the diamond snake. "She
must have done you some tremendous favour to
have earned that."</p>

<p>"She hasn't done anything yet. But I hope
she will. I hope very much that she will tell me
certain things I'm anxious to know, and afterward
help me, if necessary, to make use of the
knowledge. I wonder if she will do it?"</p>

<p>There was now a meaning in his voice which
could not be mistaken. Kate looked up quickly
and met his eyes. For, a long instant they gazed
at each other, then she said: "I think the woman
would be foolish if she didn't."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me when I buy the
thing?" asked Loria.</p>

<p>Kate smiled and flushed faintly through the
white rose balm which gave an illusion of youth.
They went in, and Loria asked to be shown the
serpent belt from the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>A very old man, an Italian, brought the glittering
thing and laid it on a piece of black velvet,
which he spread as a background on the counter.</p>

<p>"It is only two thousand francs," he
announced, "and it has a history. Perhaps I am
indiscreet to mention it, but it may add to the
interest, and I see that the illustrious Signor is
a countryman of my own. This jewel was an
heirloom in a very ancient family; but great misfortunes
overtook them some years ago. The
heir was accused of crime, and banished for life
to Noumea. They were forced to sell everything
of value."</p>

<p>Loria was ghastly. With an instinctive gesture
of horror, he pushed the velvet away, not touching
the serpent and averting his eyes.</p>

<p>"Let us choose something else," he said
hoarsely to Lady Gardiner. But she was merciless.
He had as much as offered her the belt,
and she would not give it up easily.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else half as pretty or quaint,"
she said. "I think this bit of history makes
it all the more interesting."</p>

<p>Loria did not look again at the serpent glitter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ing
on its black velvet cushion, but, having
hesitated for a barely perceptible space, he
abruptly ordered the jeweler to send the belt to
his hotel, where it would be paid for on delivery.
Kate decided that, as she was in such a vein
of luck, she would have the watch she fancied,
and keep the Marchese while she made the purchase.
Half maliciously she said to the shopkeeper:
"I suppose this pretty thing has no such
story as the other?"</p>

<p>"Rather strangely, madame has chosen
another heirloom disposed of by the same family,"
returned the man, as he placed the old blue-enameled
watch in a box filled with pink cotton.
It seemed as if Fate persisted in linking them
with these Dalahaides!</p>

<p>Loria did not speak, but Kate's observant eyes
saw that the gloved hand nearest her closed
tightly on the stick it held. A moment later she
had paid for her purchase, and they were out in
the street again.</p>

<p>"You look very down," she remarked. "I
believe you must have been losing a lot at
Monte, and that a little sympathy and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
advice would do you good. I meant to go to
Rumpelmayer's presently, but suppose we go
now and have tea together?"</p>

<p>Neither he nor she had said in so many words
that there was to be a bargain between them;
but Loria understood what the suggestion of a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te at Rumpelmayer's meant, and augured
well of Kate's genuine good-will, by her readiness
to give the opportunity he wanted.</p>

<p>She was curious, he labouring under suppressed
excitement, and they did not speak
much as they walked. At the confectioner's
Loria chose a table in a corner, far from the
few early customers who had already arrived.
It was not yet four o'clock, and the rooms
would not begin to be crowded for half an hour.
In that time much could be said, much, perhaps,
planned for the future.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE CLOSED DOOR</h3>


<p>The Marchese Loria ordered tea, and the
two newly made allies pretended to have
no important more business than eating and
drinking. But certain that nobody was within
hearing distance, Loria squandered little time
in frivolities. At any moment some one they
knew might come in and interrupt their talk.</p>

<p>"You said that I looked 'very down,'"
he began abruptly. "That is cool English
for broken-hearted, no doubt. I'm half mad,
I think, Lady Gardiner. For four nights I
haven't slept; for three days I've scarcely eaten.
You know why; there's no use in wasting
words on explanation."</p>

<p>"You love her so much?" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"I love her so much. You believe me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for you have the reputation of being a
rich man, and it can't be all a bubble, or you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
wouldn't buy eighty-pound presents&mdash;for gratitude,
and rather premature gratitude at that."</p>

<p>"Ah! the gift hasn't been made yet."</p>

<p>"I fancy it will be made. And the principle is
the same. You can't be a fortune-hunter, like
many agreeable, titled countrymen of yours
whom I have met."</p>

<p>"If a man began by seeking out Miss Beverly
as a fortune-hunter, he would end by being her
lover. She is the most beautiful girl on earth,
and&mdash;the most maddening. I think I shall go
mad if I am to lose her."</p>

<p>"How you Italians can love&mdash;and hate!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we can hate also, it is true. There is no
half-way with us. Lady Gardiner, I used to
think that you disliked me; but to-day you are
different. I was as desperately in need of help
as a drowning man, and I caught at the new look
of kindness in your eyes, as such a man catches
at a floating spar."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the appeal in your eyes that
called out the answer in mine," said Kate, half
believing that she told the truth; for there was
a certain magnetic power in the man's passion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
which was, at least, sincere. "What help can I
give you?"</p>

<p>"First of all, you can answer a few questions.
What have I done to change Miss Beverly so
completely?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't know. There's something
odd going on&mdash;something which interests her so
much that she can think of nothing else."</p>

<p>"The change began on the day of&mdash;our ride.
Our last ride! The last of everything worth
having, it has been for me. She was angry
because I was unwilling to go into&mdash;that
valley. But afterward, when she learned how
intimately I had been associated with the people
at the ch&acirc;teau there, how could she blame me?
I suppose she <i>did</i> learn the story?"</p>

<p>"She learned something of it, I know, the night
after we rode up the valley. You remember
there was a dance? I had left my fan in our
sitting-room, and ran up to find it. There was
no light in the room, and Virginia and Sir Roger
were on the balcony. Of course, I didn't mean
to listen, but I couldn't find the fan at first, and
I didn't like to startle them by suddenly switch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ing on
the light, so I&mdash;er&mdash;I overheard a little
of the conversation. Sir Roger was telling her
the story of that unfortunate Maxime Dalahaide&mdash;why,
Marchese, how you must have loved him!
The very mention of his name turns you pale."</p>

<p>"We were like brothers," said Loria in a low
voice. "But go on. Did Sir Roger Broom
mention me in connection with the story?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel! That explains all, then.
This is your honourable English gentleman, who
traduces a man behind his back, to ruin him with
the girl they both love!"</p>

<p>"You do Roger Broom injustice. He
defended you. Virginia thought that your
friendship was not worth much, since you
believed Maxime Dalahaide guilty, but Sir Roger
assured her you had behaved exceedingly well."</p>

<p>"H'm! One knows what faint praise can do.
Did he give her all the details of that loathsome
story?"</p>

<p>"No; he refused. I was rather sorry, as I
was interested by that time. Besides, I had
wanted to know, and I couldn't think of any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
it would be convenient to ask, except Sir Roger
or you."</p>

<p>"I wish he had told her all! If he had, she
would never have wished to hear of the Dalahaides
again."</p>

<p>"You speak bitterly of your old friends."</p>

<p>"I? No, you misunderstand. I mean only
that a girl&mdash;a stranger&mdash;would be horrified if
she could know the full details. It was a ghastly
affair. I loved Max, but there was no excuse for
him&mdash;none. And it would be better for Miss
Beverly to have nothing to do with that family.
They bring unhappiness to all who come near
them. It is as if they were under a curse, which
every one connected with them must share. I
can't bear to think that so black a shadow should
darken <i>her</i> sunlight. Already, you see, she has
changed. She goes once to the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche, and the spell falls upon her."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that she hasn't been more than
once," said Lady Gardiner.</p>

<p>"Ah! that was one of the things I wished to
ask. You think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. The morning after we all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
went there she disappeared for hours, and would
say nothing except that she had slept badly, got
up early, and gone off for a ride. Whether Mr.
Trent was with her or not I can't tell but when
I first saw her, after looking everywhere, they
were together, so absorbed in what they were
saying that I believe if a revolver had been fired
within a dozen yards of them they would hardly
have heard it. At luncheon that same day, Sir
Roger was telling me how he had seen the agent,
and found out about the ch&acirc;teau, as it appears
she had asked him to do&mdash;she has but to ask and
to have, with him, you must know!&mdash;and
though she was pleased and interested to a
certain extent, still, she seemed to be thinking
of something else."</p>

<p>"That <i>something else</i>! If I could find out
what that was, I might know who is taking her
from me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not as simple an affair to
unravel as that; for I can tell you one of the
things, at least, which was apparently occupying
her thoughts at the time, yet I can't quite see why
or how it could have much to do with you. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
remember, perhaps, that you came while we
were at luncheon the day after our ride into
the Valley of the Shadow, and proposed that
we should all go to Monte Carlo on your motor-car,
that we should spend the afternoon in the
Casino, and dine with you at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris?
Virginia said that she had important letters to
write, and couldn't go; and her manner was
rather distant."</p>

<p>"It chilled my heart."</p>

<p>"Well, she asked Sir Roger and Mr. Trent
to come up to her sitting-room after luncheon.
Naturally, I was there too; I've been told to
look upon the room as my own. She did not tell
what she had been doing in the morning, but,
wherever she had been, she had contrived to
discover a good deal more about the Dalahaide
story than Sir Roger had been willing to tell her
the night before, and she announced boldly, that
in spite of everything, she believed Maxime
Dalahaide was innocent. She demanded of
Roger&mdash;who has spent a good deal of time in
France, you know, and is supposed to be well up
in French law&mdash;whether it wouldn't be possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to have the case brought up again, with the best
lawyers in the country, expense to be no object.
When Roger had shown her that the thing
couldn't be done, and there was no use discussing
it, she wanted him to say that by setting some
wonderful detectives on the trail of the real
criminal the truth might be discovered, and the
man unjustly accused brought home in triumph
from Noumea by a penitent Government. Sir
Roger assured her that was hopeless. That, in
the first place, Maxime Dalahaide wasn't
innocent, and that, in the second place,
even if he were, his innocence would be still
more impossible to prove after all these
years than it would have been at the time
of the trial."</p>

<p>"What did she reply to that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. She was silent and seemed
impressed. She became very thoughtful. Since
then I have not heard her say one word of
the Dalahaides, except incidentally about the
ch&acirc;teau, which she actually means to buy, and
have restored in time to come to it, if she likes,
next year. Now, I don't see why her interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in the Dalahaides, if she continues to feel it,
should interfere with her friendship for you."</p>

<p>Loria did not answer. He sat thinking
intently, his dark eyes staring unseeingly out of
the window. At last he spoke. "Why&mdash;<i>why</i>
should she interest herself in this cold-blooded
murderer, whose best friends turned from him
in horror at his crime? Is it pure philanthropy?
Has the sister implored Miss Beverly to throw
her money into this bottomless gulf? What
happened when you were at the ch&acirc;teau that day
I never knew."</p>

<p>"We thought that the subject was disagreeable
to you," said Kate. "We saw and spoke with
Miss Dalahaide, a pale, cold girl, dressed in
black, with a voice that somehow sounded&mdash;<i>dead</i>.
She did not mention her brother, and
seemed so reserved that I should think it would
be difficult to break the ice with her. Indeed,
she appeared very annoyed at the necessity for
showing us a little room with a life-size picture
in it, which I fancied must be a portrait of the
brother."</p>

<p>A curious shiver passed through Loria's body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Beverly saw that portrait?" he asked in
a low, strained voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I noticed that she kept glancing at
it again and again while we stopped in the room.
I suppose a morbid sort of curiosity regarding
a murderer is natural, even in a young girl,
provided his personality is interesting."</p>

<p>Once more Loria remained silent, his face set
in hard lines.</p>

<p>"Such a man as Maxime Dalahaide must have
been before his fall, would be a dangerous rival,"
Lady Gardiner went on, with a spice of malice.
She was watching Loria as she spoke, and
thrilled a little at the look in his eyes as he
turned them upon her. "Oh, these Italians!"
she thought. "They are so emotional that they
frighten one. Their passions are like caged
tigers, and you never quite know whether the
cage door is safely locked."</p>

<p>"Maxime Dalahaide will never be dangerous
to any man again on this earth&mdash;not even to
himself, since the worst has happened to him
that can happen," answered Loria.</p>

<p>"Strange if, although he is buried in a prison-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>land
at the other end of the world, he might still,
in a vague, dim way, be a rival to fear more than
another," Kate reflected dreamily. Aloud she
went on: "It seems ridiculous to say so, but I
believe that Virginia is making a hero of him.
She has never seen this man&mdash;she never can see
him; yet his image&mdash;evolved from that portrait
at the ch&acirc;teau which was his old home&mdash;may
blur others nearer to her."</p>

<p>"Great heavens! You believe that?"</p>

<p>"I merely suggest it. The idea only occurred
to me at this moment. But Virginia is certainly
thinking of Maxime Dalahaide. To-day, she
was reading a French book about Noumea.
She hid it when I came into the room; but later
I came across it by accident. Yes, she is thinking
of him, but it is only a girl's foolish, romantic
fancy, of course&mdash;a spoilt child, crying for the
moon, because it's the one thing that no adoring
person can get for her. I shouldn't worry about
it much, if I were you. Indeed, perhaps she
sees herself that she is not very wise, and wants
to forget. Now she has set her heart on
a yachting trip; but you must not speak of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
it to her or the others, for she asked me not
to tell."</p>

<p>"She gives me little enough chance to speak
of anything. A short time ago she would not
have cared for a yachting trip, unless I were to
be of the party. Now, I suppose, her wish is
to be rid of me."</p>

<p>"Her wish is also to be rid of me."</p>

<p>"You are not to go?"</p>

<p>"Not if Virginia can make a decent excuse to
leave me behind."</p>

<p>"Who, then, goes with her?"</p>

<p>"Her half-brother, and Sir Roger Broom. She
isn't even going to take a maid."</p>

<p>"Heavens! It is Sir Roger Broom, then, who
will win her!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think. She has
refused him; he is many years older than she,
and she has known him since she was a child,
for Sir Roger went often to America while her
father&mdash;his cousin&mdash;was alive. Why should
she suddenly make up her mind to marry him?
He was her guardian during her minority, or
what remained of it after her father's death;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
now she has had her one-and-twentieth birthday,
and is her own mistress. I fancied that she
intended to remain so for a time, unless she lost
her head&mdash;or her heart&mdash;and Sir Roger, nice
as he is, is scarcely the man to make a girl like
Virginia Beverly do either. Still, I don't understand
the yachting trip. It is in every way
mysterious; and since you have asked my
advice, it is this: find out where they are
going, and appear there, as if by chance. By
that time our spoiled beauty's mind may
have changed."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me where they are going?"</p>

<p>"I would if I could." This was true, since
Kate was sure that, change as Virginia might,
she would never return to her brief, ballroom
fancy for the Italian. "I hinted at Naples,
Greece, and Egypt, and Virginia answered that
it would be 'something of the sort'&mdash;answered
evasively, saying nothing was decided yet; and
so the conversation would have ended if George
Trent hadn't come bursting in, very excited, exclaiming
before he saw me that he'd got hold of
exactly the right steam yacht, with <i>four cannon</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Loria started like a sensitive woman. "A
yacht with four cannon! What can they want
with cannon?"</p>

<p>"I asked if they were fitting out for pirates,
and Mr. Trent assured me that the cannon being
on board was a mere accident; they would not
have them removed, but they had no intention of
making use of them. Still, there's no doubt that
there's some mystery behind this yachting expedition.
I can't make it out at all. Whether it is
Mr. Trent's plan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he would not wish to go without you."</p>

<p>"A few days ago, perhaps not. But others
besides Virginia have changed. That day when
we rode up the Valley of the Shadow, as they
call it, was destined to be an eventful day for
us all."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that George Trent is a different man
since he went to the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche."</p>

<p>A dark flush rose to Loria's forehead. "He
met Madeleine Dalahaide?"</p>

<p>"One might think, from your expression and
accent, that you were jealous."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"One would think wrongly then. A man can't
be in love with two women at the same time."</p>

<p>"Can't he? I wasn't sure. Men are strange;
perhaps there's something of the dog in the
manger about them, at times. At all events,
George Trent is much interested in the yachting
trip, and he <i>doesn't</i> want me to go. Perhaps
Miss Dalahaide is to be of the party; and in that
case I should be the odd woman. Not that it
matters to me. George was pleasant to flirt with
but I should not marry again, unless I married
money. Virginia's great fortune comes from
her father, George's step-father, who was jealous
of the mother's affection for the first husband's
son, and disliked him. George will accept
nothing from Virginia, and has only what his
mother could leave him&mdash;a miserable five
thousand dollars a year."</p>

<p>Loria scarcely listened. His level black brows
were drawn together. "She was reading a book
about Noumea," he said slowly. "What if&mdash;no,
it is impossible&mdash;impossible!"</p>

<p>"What is impossible? If I am to help you,
you must have no secrets from me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"She could not hope, if she went there, to
see him. Bah! The bare thought is monstrous."</p>

<p>"It is a little far-fetched," said Kate. "I
should think the adventure they are undertaking
will be no more startling than an attempt to
reach the Second Cataract. The cannon <i>might</i>
be needed there, you know."</p>

<p>"That is true. But, Lady Gardiner, you
must find out where they are going, and let
me know. A hundred diamond serpents would
not be enough to testify my gratitude. You
mean to go with them?"</p>

<p>"If they will take me."</p>

<p>"They must take you. They must! You are
my only hope, the only link that will be left
between me and Virginia Beverly. Listen!
We are talking frankly to each other, you and I.
We never thought to be such friends&mdash;but we
are friends, and must trust each other to succeed.
You often speak, half-jestingly, of being
poor. I have money&mdash;I don't say enough;
who has enough? But I am not a poor man.
Watch Virginia for me; watch Sir Roger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Broom. Let me know where this yacht is
taking you, whom she carries, all that happens
on board of her. Advise me, from what you
see of passing events; and for all these services,
worth an inestimable sum to me, I will
give you what I can afford&mdash;say, a thousand
pounds. You shall have half down the day
you start, and the other half the day that you
return."</p>

<p>"You are generous; and&mdash;I will be loyal,"
said Kate. "It will not be my fault, I promise
you, if the yacht sails without me. Now I must
go. We must have been talking here for more
than an hour, for Virginia's carriage, which she
lent me, has just driven up to the door. Whenever
there is a new development of this mystery,
which interests us both, you shall know it. I
wish I could take you up to Cap Martin with me,
if you are ready to go that way, but perhaps it
would be wiser not&mdash;especially as the victoria
isn't my own."</p>

<p>Kate Gardiner had not been in the hotel an
hour when a box was brought to her door by the
Marchese Loria's valet. Inside was the diamond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
serpent. She told herself that she had done a
very good afternoon's work.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Soon every one knew that the American heiress
and beauty, Miss Virginia Beverly, had bought,
for twenty thousand pounds, the famous steam
yacht which the mad Spanish Prince d'Almidares
had used as a despatch boat at the time of the
American war with Spain. For some time it
had been for sale, lying in harbour at Nice;
but it had been too costly a toy; the cannon
with which it was armed were worth only the
price of old iron to most buyers of yachts.
They were equally useless to Miss Beverly and
her party, as she and George Trent and Roger
Broom impressed upon all who asked questions;
but, then, what was the use in wasting time
enough to dismantle the yacht, as she was wanted
immediately, and the cannon were too cleverly
concealed to injure the smart appearance of the
little craft?</p>

<p>It was given out that the <i>Bella Cuba</i> would
touch at Greece, go on to Egypt, and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
visit Algiers and Lisbon, steaming at last up the
Thames to Tilbury. Virginia Beverly ostentatiously
bought thin summer clothing, saying that
it would be summer weather on the sea before she
bade good-bye to the water. Still, Virginia
announced that she did not wish to be bound
down to a definite programme, and Kate Gardiner
had to be satisfied with a prospect of vagueness
if she intended to be of the party.</p>

<p>Not for a single moment had she abandoned
that intention. Even if she had not stood to earn
a thousand pounds she would have moved heaven
and earth to go, for more and more, as the days
of preparation went on, her curiosity and
excitement increased.</p>

<p>Roger Broom, it was clear, had been intensely
annoyed when he was informed that Lady
Gardiner had so far overcome her fear of the
sea, as to wish to be a passenger on the <i>Bella
Cuba</i>. He had said little, but his face was
expressive, and Kate was of opinion that he
would have said a great deal more, had not
some strong motive restrained him. Perhaps,
she thought, this motive was fear of rousing her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
suspicions if he too emphatically advocated her
stopping behind. But&mdash;suspicions of <i>what</i>?
That was the question she often asked herself,
and could never answer.</p>

<p>She had asked it of Loria also, when they met&mdash;as
secretly as if the bond between them had
been a forbidden love. But if the truth about
the yachting trip had been told, even he had no
solution ready for the puzzle.</p>

<p>At last the yacht, which had been re-painted,
was ready, the captain and crew of picked men,
all Englishmen, were engaged, and the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> steamed into the harbour at Mentone,
exactly one month from the date (as Kate
happened to remember) of the eventful ride into
the Valley of the Shadow.</p>

<p>They were to start in two days, and Lady
Gardiner's heart sank at the thought of all the
physical suffering she was doomed to endure.
Nevertheless, when Virginia hinted that, if she
chose to think better of her decision, it was not
yet too late, she courageously assured the girl that
she was looking forward to the trip. She had
always wanted to see Egypt!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The yacht was swift, and had proved herself
seaworthy, but she was comparatively small, and
when Kate went on board with Virginia to inspect
the accommodation, she was surprised to be
shown only five passenger cabins. Still, as she
had been informed that there were to be but
four in the party, she did not see why it would
be impossible for Virginia's maid to go, and
ventured to say as much.</p>

<p>"But we have decided to take a doctor,"
explained Virginia. "We shall be so long at
sea that otherwise it really wouldn't be safe."</p>

<p>"For my part I'd much rather have a maid
than a doctor," sighed Kate, to whom Virginia's
Celestine had made herself agreeably useful.
"We shall have nothing worse the matter with
us than seasickness; and how <i>are</i> we to do our
hair?"</p>

<p>Thus bemoaning her fate, she passed along
the line of white and gold painted doors, and
stopped suddenly at a sixth, the only one which
was closed. Gently she tried the handle. It
did not yield.</p>

<p>"One would think that this ought to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
another cabin," she remarked sweetly; "else
what becomes of the symmetry? Now, if
only it <i>were</i> one, you might take Celestine.
You'd be so <i>much</i> more comfortable."</p>

<p>"That cabin can't be used," Virginia said,
her eyes very bright, her cheeks very red. "And
if you want Celestine, Kate, you must stop on
land."</p>

<p>Lady Gardiner at once protested that she was
not thinking of <i>herself</i>; oh, indeed no! but merely
of her <i>dear</i> girl, who was not used to being her
own maid. She said no more of the locked door,
but she could think of nothing else. Why could
the cabin not be used, and why had Virginia
suddenly grown cross at the bare suggestion that
it should be? Was it possible that Madeleine
Dalahaide was going after all, that her presence
was to be kept secret from Kate until the last
moment, and that she was to have this stateroom?
Perhaps, Lady Gardiner's jealous suspicion
whispered, she was already in the cabin,
and had locked herself in, fearing just such an
intrusion as the turned key had prevented.</p>

<p>That night she saw Loria, and told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
precisely what had happened on board. "I
shouldn't wonder," she said reflectively, "if the
whole mystery of this trip were not on the other
side of that closed door. Something tells me
it is so."</p>

<p>"When do you start?" asked the Italian.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at five in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Could you make an excuse to go on board in
the morning alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Celestine has taken most of our things
on to-day, and put them away for us. We are
not supposed to leave the hotel till three o'clock.
But I could say I had lost something, and hoped
that I'd left it on the <i>Bella Cuba</i>. Or perhaps I
could slip on board without saying anything until
afterward. But what good would it do me?
The door isn't likely to be unlocked; and I can
see nothing through the keyhole. I tried this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I will get you a key which, if there isn't one
already on the inside, will open the door."</p>

<p>In the night Kate Gardiner had strange dreams
of the locked cabin. Twenty times in her
sleep she was on the point of finding out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
secret, but always woke before she had made it
her own. She was up early in the morning, and
went out, saying, as if carelessly, to Celestine,
that she must buy a few last things which she
had forgotten. In the town she met Loria, as
they had arranged over-night, and he put into
her hand something in a sealed envelope.</p>

<p>"You are sure this will do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sure," returned the Italian.</p>

<p>Then they parted; Kate took a small boat and
was rowed out to the <i>Bella Cuba</i>, which lay
anchored not far from shore.</p>

<p>"I have come on board to look for a diamond
ring which I think I dropped in my cabin yesterday,"
she remarked to the captain.</p>

<p>He turned away, all unsuspicious and Kate
hurried to the saloon off which the cabins opened.
Already she had broken the seal on the envelope,
and taken out a small, peculiarly shaped steel
implement. With a quick glance over her
shoulder and a loud beating of the heart, she
thrust the master-key into the lock of the closed
door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE LADY ON THE VERANDAH</h3>


<p>No one was coming; Lady Gardiner dared
to turn the key. The door opened, and
she looked into the room beyond.</p>

<p>It was a cabin, of the same size as the others, and
fitted up as a stateroom, but furnished and decorated
differently. The five which Kate had been
shown yesterday were comfortable, but not particularly
luxurious, and she had wondered, since
this was ostensibly a pleasure trip, that beauty-loving
Virginia had not thought it worth while to
have her own cabin, at least, made more dainty.</p>

<p>In the locked stateroom, whose secret Kate
was violating, the berth was hung with old
brocaded silk of blue and silver, the curtains
edged with curious thick lace, yellowed by
time. On the floor lay a beautiful tiger-skin,
covering it from end to end. A large fitted
travelling-bag stood open on a cushioned seat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
showing silver-topped bottles; and the wall on
one side of the cabin was almost hidden with
photographs and sketches which had been
tacked up, over a low book-shelf, filled with
volumes in uniform binding of blue and gold.
The photographs were of places as well as people,
and Kate had just identified the Valley of the
Shadow, dominated by the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche,
when a sudden sound sent her out of the cabin
and into the saloon, with her heart pounding and
her nerves throbbing, in shamed fear of discovery.</p>

<p>She had just time to lock the door and pass on
to that of her own stateroom when Celestine
appeared, carrying various small parcels. She
had been sent to the yacht by her mistress to
finish a few preparations for the voyage, and was
surprised to see Lady Gardiner. Kate, however,
was prepared with her story of the lost ring, which
no doubt Celestine would repeat to Virginia, and
produced the jewel, saying that fortunately she
had found it on the floor of her cabin.</p>

<p>The maid had no suspicion, probably did not
dream that the <i>Bella Cuba</i> had a secret to keep,
and Lady Gardiner was rowed back to shore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
confident that she had come safely out of the
morning's adventure. The mystery, however,
remained a mystery, except that Kate was certain
now of one thing which she had only
suspected. There was to be a passenger on
board the <i>Bella Cuba</i>, whose expected presence
had carefully been concealed from her. For
this passenger elaborate preparations had been
made. Everything behind that locked door
was beautiful, but nothing was new. In the
fleeting glimpse Kate had obtained before the
sound of Celestine's descending steps had sent
her flying from her stolen inspection, she had
been impressed with the feeling that the decorations
of the stateroom had all been taken
from some other room, with the view of surrounding
its occupant with old associations.</p>

<p>Lady Gardiner hoped to see Loria before
going back to the hotel, and an appointment
had been made, to be kept as nearly to the time
as possible; but he was not at Rumpelmayer's,
the place of meeting, and, astonished at his
defection, she was obliged to return to the Cap
Martin without the expected talk. In her room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
she found a line from the Italian. Sir Roger
Broom had seen him at Rumpelmayer's, he
explained, and had joined him there. Fearing
that Lady Gardiner might come in while they
were together, he pleaded an engagement and
went out, still accompanied by Broom. Now,
Loria asked, was it possible that Miss Beverly's
cousin suspected anything? Had Lady Gardiner
been imprudent and dropped the slightest
hint of their new allegiance?</p>

<p>Kate had begun a note in reply, when Virginia
knocked at her door, inquiring whether she were
ready for luncheon. "Wait for me just a
moment in the sitting-room," said the elder
woman, and, her ideas confused in the necessity
for haste, she merely scrawled: "Don't think
Sir Roger or any one suspects. Must have been
an accident. Key worked well. I saw cabin.
It is ready for a passenger. I would wager that
that passenger is Madeleine Dalahaide. Probably
we shall not have a word together in private now
before we go, but will write you from every port,
or wire if necessary and possible.&mdash;K. G."</p>

<p>This note she took down to the dining-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
with her, and barely had a chance to press it into
Loria's palm as he bade her, with the others, a
rather formal farewell.</p>

<p>The Marchese was not one of those who went
out to the yacht to see the last of the beautiful
American girl and her party. Virginia had
definitely refused him now, and the old, pleasant
intimacy had been brought to a sudden end.
Nevertheless, he sent her flowers&mdash;a great
basket of roses big enough to fill up half of her
stateroom on the <i>Bella Cuba</i>&mdash;which she
promptly gave to Kate, with various other
elaborate offerings, keeping for her own cabin
only a small bunch of fragrant violets sent by
some one whose name she seemed to guess,
although there was no card.</p>

<p>So, at last, they were off; and no sad-faced
girl in black had appeared. Besides the original
party of four, there was only a little dark, keen-eyed
English doctor, taken from his practice in
Mentone. He looked like a man who would
know how to keep a secret, and Kate wondered
whether the mystery of the <i>Bella Cuba</i> were a
mystery to Dr. Grayle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Dalahaide will come on board at
Naples," Kate said to herself when it became
certain that they would stop there. "She is
well known in Mentone, no doubt, and didn't
wish it to leak out that she was going on this
yachting trip."</p>

<p>But they arrived at Naples, sent off telegrams
and letters, coaled, and left without taking on
another passenger. Always it seemed to Kate
that Virginia's manner showed suppressed nervous
excitement. She was restless, capricious,
took an interest in nothing for more than ten
minutes together. She had never been to
Naples before, yet she appeared to grudge the two
or three hours they spent in driving about, and
would not listen to Kate's suggestion that they
should stop long enough for a visit to Pompeii.</p>

<p>"Next time," she said evasively. Altogether,
she had not at all the air of a young woman
yachting for pleasure, as of course she must be,
since what other object could the trip have? "I
am in a hurry to see Cairo," she replied, when
Lady Gardiner inquired the reason of her
impatience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, they did not touch at Greece, but
went straight on to Alexandria, the sea being so
calmly unruffled that even Kate had no excuse
for illness. She might have been very happy in
these long, lazy, blue-and-gold days, if George
Trent had been his old self. But the frost which
had withered the flower of his fancy for her that
day in the Valley of the Shadow, had never
thawed. He read and smoked a great deal,
leaving Roger Broom to amuse Virginia and
Lady Gardiner.</p>

<p>Something went wrong with the engine the
morning when they expected to reach Alexandria
and Kate heard talk of a "heated bearing on the
crankshaft," which might have to be taken off,
thus delaying them a couple of days. "But a
couple of days!" she exclaimed in surprise.
"Surely you mean to stop longer than that!"</p>

<p>"We hadn't thought of it," answered Roger
drily.</p>

<p>"Are you going up the Nile then?"</p>

<p>"No; the <i>Bella Cuba</i> is rather big, you know."</p>

<p>"Not so big as the excursion boats that go,
is she?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Virginia doesn't care about it, anyhow; she
loves the sea for its own sake, and hasn't come as
much for sight-seeing as for a complete rest.
While the repairs are being done we shall run up
to Cairo by rail, stop a night at the Ghezireh
Palace, and drive out for a look at the Sphinx
and the Pyramids."</p>

<p>"You really are the most extraordinary
people!" ejaculated Kate. "I don't know what
to make of you."</p>

<p>Roger smiled, and was silent. He had the air
of thinking it of small importance whether or not
Lady Gardiner, who had insisted upon coming
on this trip, knew what to make of her hosts and
hostess. But, then, Sir Roger Broom had never
more than tolerated this most charming of
companions.</p>

<p>Kate had kept the master-key which Loria had
given her, and had never ceased to hope for
another chance to investigate the locked stateroom,
which might, she told herself sometimes,
have a hidden occupant. To be sure, so far as
she knew, no other passengers had come on
board at Naples; but, then, they had all been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
away from the yacht for several hours, and
some one might have been smuggled into the
cabin. With this fancy lurking in her mind,
she would have given much for a second peep;
but she had never found a moment when it
seemed safe to run the risk.</p>

<p>She could imagine no reason, if Madeleine
Dalahaide had come on board at Naples, beyond
spying-distance of old acquaintances, why she
should remain hidden in the stateroom, unless,
indeed, there were some truth in Loria's suggestion
that the yacht was bound for New Caledonia,
to take the girl out to her convict brother.
In that case, perhaps, it might conceivably be
necessary to keep the captain and crew in ignorance
of her presence, lest they should gossip in
port. Still, Virginia's restlessness, her lack of
interest in the beautiful places so easy to visit,
her desire to remain on board when the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> was in port, seemed to point to some
peculiar motive under her indifference to all
pleasures of the trip.</p>

<p>In Alexandria, the girl "did not see why they
should pack up to stop a night in Cairo." What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
if the crankshaft could be repaired sooner than
they supposed? Then they would be wasting
time. But she was overruled, and just before
sunset they drove up to one of the most beautiful
hotels in the world.</p>

<p>The evening chill was beginning to fall, yet
many people still lingered on the huge terrace
overlooking the Nile, where the "winging"
sails of the little boats were pink and golden as
mother-o'-pearl, reflecting the crimson glory of
the sky. A woman sitting alone at a little table
looked up as they passed, and with a slight start.
Virginia half stopped, staring almost rudely at
the face which was lifted for a moment. But it
was only for a moment.</p>

<p>The woman, who was exceedingly handsome,
of the most luscious Spanish type of beauty,
flushed under the American girl's intent gaze,
drew up a sable cape which had partly fallen
from the shoulders of her white cloth dress,
and turned a resentful back.</p>

<p>"What a handsome creature, but awfully
made up!" whispered Kate, who had no mercy
on her own sex.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia did not answer. She walked on,
looking as if she had awakened from a dream.</p>

<p>At dinner that night, next to the party from
the yacht, was a small table laid for one. It was
unoccupied until they had half finished dinner;
then heads began suddenly to turn toward the
door; people whispered, there was a perceptible,
though scarcely definable thrill of interest, and a
tall woman in sequined black tulle, glittering
with diamonds, came slowly up the room. She
must have known that all eyes were upon her,
yet she appeared unconscious. Her lashes were
cast down as she moved toward a chair held
obsequiously ready by a waiter at the little
empty table, and their dusky length was not
second even to Virginia's. As the newcomer
sat down, she faced Roger Broom.</p>

<p>"That woman's face looks somehow familiar
to me," he said, "yet I can't think where, if
ever, I have seen it. I suppose it can only be a
chance resemblance to somebody or other."</p>

<p>Virginia opened her lips to speak, but closed
them again hastily. Kate then threw a questioning
glance her way, and saw that she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
suddenly grown pale. "I wish you or George
would find out who she is," the girl said presently.
"She is one of the handsomest women I ever
saw. If possible, I should like to know her."</p>

<p>"I can promise that you shall at least know
her name," replied Roger, smiling. "It
wouldn't be safe to say more." And, true to
his word, an hour after dinner he came to the
private drawing-room where Virginia and Lady
Gardiner sat, with the required information.</p>

<p>"The strange beauty is a Portuguese countess,"
he announced. "Her name is De Mattos,
and she is a widow, spending the winter here
alone, except for her maid. She is much
admired, especially by men, but apparently does
not care to make acquaintances; otherwise,
as she seems to be a person whose name the
gossips respect, your wish might perhaps have
been gratified."</p>

<p>"Have you remembered yet where you saw
her before?"</p>

<p>"I've remembered where I saw some one like
her. But it is not the same woman."</p>

<p>"You're sure?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Absolutely. The other was a blonde with
Titian hair. And she has been dead for years."</p>

<p>Virginia said no more, and appeared to forget
the Portuguese countess. But when Lady Gardiner
complained of being tired, and went off
to bed, that she might be fresh for sight-seeing
next morning, also to write a puzzled letter to
the Marchese Loria, Virginia remained. George
Trent had gone to a Cairene theatre, and she
and Roger were alone together.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed upon Kate
Gardiner, when the girl sprang up from her
chair, and before Roger knew what she meant
to do, was sitting on a divan beside him, her
hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Roger," she exclaimed, "I thank you a
thousand, thousand times for insisting that I
should come here."</p>

<p>"You haven't seen anything yet," he returned.
"Thank me after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It's the most wonderful thing in the world
that we should have come," she went on. "If
we had employed the cleverest detectives in
Paris and London they might never have dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>covered
what chance, merest chance&mdash;if there
is such a thing as chance&mdash;has put into our
hands to-night."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, dear child?"
asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I'm talking about Liane Devereux, the
actress that Maxime Dalahaide is supposed to
have murdered. You've been very good, Roger.
I've appreciated it, for you never believed in
his innocence. Now you must believe, in spite
of yourself, since she is here, calling herself the
Countess de Mattos."</p>

<p>Roger stared at her in amazement. "But
this is madness, dear," he said. "Liane Devereux
was murdered; whether Maxime Dalahaide
or another was her murderer, there is no
possible doubt that she is dead. You can't
know the story as well as I thought you did,
if you don't put that beyond questioning."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Liane Devereux is in this house,
and Providence sent me here to see her. It's
that which is beyond question."</p>

<p>"Did Madeleine Dalahaide show you the
woman's picture?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, two pictures; a photograph and an
ivory miniature. She kept them because they
were her brother's, just as she kept everything
of his. I looked at them again and again, until
I knew the features line by line. I can't be
mistaken. This is the same woman. There
was an even deeper mystery about that murder
than Maxime Dalahaide's best friends guessed."</p>

<p>Roger Broom shrugged his shoulders with a
despairing laugh. "For light-hearted trampling
on established facts, give me an American
girl!" he exclaimed. "A woman is murdered,
her body found, identified, buried. Four or
five years afterward another woman appears,
a brunette, while Number One was blonde.
Number One, a Frenchwoman, was murdered
in Paris; Number Two, a Portuguese, is spending
the winter in Cairo. There is absolutely
nothing to link these women together except
a resemblance of feature, which, though strong,
is not convincing even to a man who saw Number
One on the stage many times. Yet here comes
a maiden from the States, who was in the
schoolroom in her own country when Number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
One was murdered, and insists, because she
has seen a portrait or two, that Liane Devereux,
the dead actress, and the Countess de Mattos
are one and the same."</p>

<p>"I know it sounds childish," admitted Virginia,
with unwonted meekness; "nevertheless,
I'm absolutely sure. I'd stake my life on it,
if it were necessary."</p>

<p>"How do you proceed to explain the identification
and burial of Liane Devereux's body if she
is now alive in Cairo?"</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to explain&mdash;yet. There
was a mistake&mdash;that's all I can say."</p>

<p>"Liane Devereux was too well known for
that to be possible. Besides, if there had been
such a mistake, another woman, murdered and
buried in her place, must have been missing.
As a matter of fact, no other woman was
missing."</p>

<p>"You mean no other woman's disappearance
was discovered."</p>

<p>"You're incorrigible! I know you're wrong;
but, admitting for the sake of argument that
you might be right, what use could you make of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
this marvellous private information, supplied
to your brain only? If the Countess de Mattos
is really Liane Devereux, come to life, one might
be sure that a woman clever enough to plan from
the beginning so astounding an affair would
be too clever to leave any tracks behind her."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is one of the difficulties," said
Virginia. "Only somehow we must get over it."</p>

<p>"I hope, my dear free-lance detective, that
you aren't plotting to accuse the Countess to
her face, and have a dramatic scene in the hall
of the Ghezireh Palace?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet what to do," the girl
answered slowly. "But I don't want to leave
Cairo until after we've done something."</p>

<p>"Believe me, there's nothing to do. We are
on a wild-goose chase as it is; don't let's complicate
things by a suit for slander just as it's
begun. My advice is, dear, put this mad idea
out of your head, and let's get on about our
business as quickly as we can&mdash;as quickly as
you yourself wanted to do a few hours ago."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry I can't take your advice,"
said Virginia. "I'm growing superstitious. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
believe that I was brought here for a particular
purpose, and I don't mean to go until, in some
way, I've accomplished that purpose."</p>

<p>Roger sighed, and said no more. He had
exhausted his stock of arguments; he knew
Virginia almost as well as he loved her. He had
promised co&ouml;peration; and though there had
been no bargaining, she had voluntarily led him
to hope for a reward which, to him, was beyond
any other happiness the world might hold.
Therefore he could do nothing but bow to the
inevitable, and await developments, which meant,
with a girl like Virginia Beverly, expecting the
unexpected.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Suddenly in the night Virginia sat up in bed
and exclaimed aloud: "Oh, if I could!" Kate
Gardiner, in a room adjoining, heard her, and
supposed that she was talking in her sleep. But
the truth was that a plan had at that instant
sprung fully armed from her brain, like Minerva
from the head of Jove; a plan so daring that the
bare thought was an electric shock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not sleep after its conception, but
lay tossing and tingling until it was time to get
up. Every moment would be long now until the
machinery could be set in motion, and she
bathed and dressed hastily, having long ago
ceased actively to miss Celestine's lost ministrations.</p>

<p>There was no sound in the next room. Kate
was not yet awake, evidently; and so, as she
took quite two hours for dressing and beautifying,
it would be foolish to wait for her. Virginia
went downstairs, looking about in vain for
Roger or George, and stepped out on to the
wide verandah, for a look at the Nile by morning
light. To her joy the beautiful Portuguese
countess was there, breakfasting alone, with a
yellow-covered French novel open on the little
table before her. Virginia instantly decided
that she would also breakfast on the verandah,
and as near to the Countess as possible.</p>

<p>As the American girl's pale blue serge rustled
its silk lining along the floor, the Portuguese
woman raised her eyes from the novel she was
reading as she sipped her coffee. The eyes had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
appeared almost black in the evening; now
Virginia saw that they were a curious, greenish
gray, and her heart gave a leap, for the eyes of
Liane Devereux, in the painted ivory miniature,
had been gray.</p>

<p>Now or never, Virginia said to herself, was the
time to begin the campaign. She seized the tide
of fortune at its flood, and spoke in English,
making the most of the pretty, drawling Southern
accent of the State after which she had been
named, because American girls were privileged to
be eccentric.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she said. "Oh, I do hope
you understand my language, because I want
to tell you something."</p>

<p>The green-gray eyes of the Countess shone
keenly between their heavy black fringes during
a silent moment of inspection, which must have
shown her Virginia divinely young, and childishly
innocent of guile. At the end of the
moment she smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand English, and speak it a
little," she responded, with a charming accent,
and in a voice musical but unexpectedly deep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"You are American, is it not? What have you to
tell me&mdash;that we have met before, somewhere?"</p>

<p>At this&mdash;or Virginia imagined it&mdash;there
came again a steely flash from the black lashes.
"Oh, no," said the girl hurriedly. "I never
saw you until yesterday. What I want to tell
you is, that I hope you will forgive me for staring
at you as I did then. I was afraid you'd think
me rude. But I just couldn't help it, you are
so beautiful. I adore beauty. You can be
sure now I'm American, can't you? for nobody
but an American girl would say such things to a
perfect stranger. I'm glad I <i>am</i> American, for
if I didn't speak I don't see exactly how I should
get to know you. And I want to know you
very much. I made my cousin, Sir Roger
Broom&mdash;he's English, though I'm American&mdash;ask
who you were, so I heard your name.
Mine is Virginia Beverly. Now we're introduced,
aren't we?"</p>

<p>The Countess laughed and looked pleased.
"I have seen your name in the journals," she
said&mdash;"the journals of society all over the
world, that one reads in hotels when one has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
nothing better to do, is it not? They told the
truth in one thing, for they said that you were
<i>tr&egrave;s belle</i>. And you have bought the yacht of a
Spanish gentleman, whom I have known a little.
Yes, I remember it was a Miss Virginia Beverly,
for it is not a name to forget; and I love yachting."</p>

<p>By this time, Virginia had ordered her breakfast
and received it, but she was far too excited
to make more than a pretense at eating. It was
almost as if the Countess de Mattos were playing
into her hands. It seemed too good to be true.
She was afraid that something would happen
to ruin all; that she would lose her head, and
by her precipitancy put the other on her guard;
yet the opportunity was too admirable to be
entirely neglected.</p>

<p>"If you like yachting, it would be nice if
you could come and have a day's run with us,"
said the girl. "The <i>Bella Cuba</i> is at Alexandria,
and we should all love taking you. My cousin
and my half-brother, George Trent, couldn't
talk of anything but you last night. Perhaps,
later, we might arrange it, if the railway journey
both ways wouldn't bore you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the contrary, I should be charmed,"
replied the Countess. She flushed, and her eyes
brightened. Virginia looked at her admiringly,
yet sharply, and said to herself: "If that rich,
dark complexion of yours is make-up&mdash;as it
must be to prove my theory right&mdash;then it's the
cleverest make-up that any woman ever had as
a disguise."</p>

<p>At this moment Sir Roger Broom and George
Trent came out on to the verandah together, both
looking very much surprised to see Virginia in
conversation with the Countess de Mattos.</p>

<p>"Can she have said anything?" Roger thought
quickly. But the calm expression of the beautiful,
dark face was in itself an answer to his
silent question.</p>

<p>The two men strolled up to Virginia, who
asked and received permission from the Countess
to introduce her brother and cousin; and soon
they were talking as if they had known each
other for days instead of moments.</p>

<p>The Portuguese beauty was distinctly ingratiating
in her manner to all three, so much so that
Roger became thoughtful. He was more certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
than ever, if that were possible, that this woman
was not Liane Devereux, for the voice was many
tones deeper, and the Countess spoke English
with an accent that was not at all French.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that no woman could disguise
herself so completely&mdash;face, voice, mannerisms,
accent&mdash;no matter how clever she
might be; besides, Virginia's idea was ridiculous.
But he began to wonder whether the lovely
Portuguese had a right to her title, or, if she had,
whether it were as well gilded as her charming
frocks and her residence at this expensive hotel
would suggest at first sight.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that she caught too readily
at new acquaintances for a rich and haughty
daughter of Portuguese aristocracy, and though
he believed that he understood, only too well,
Virginia's motive for cultivating a friendship,
he was inclined to fear that the girl might be
victimized by an adventuress.</p>

<p>The Countess de Mattos was too handsome
and too striking not to have been remarked in
Cairo, no matter how quietly she might live at
the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, and he determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to make inquiries of some officers whom he
knew there.</p>

<p>At all events, plans for the present were
changed. Instead of a day or two in Cairo they
were to stay on indefinitely. George, as well
as Roger, was taken into the secret, but Lady
Gardiner was told only the fact. She was
pleased at first, for she was fond of Cairo, and
had never had a chance to stop there in luxury
before. She did not, however, like the Countess
de Mattos, who was much too handsome to be
acceptable to her; and before the slower and
more prudent Roger had learnt anything, she was
primed with all the gossip of the hotel regarding
the Portuguese beauty. There was a certain Mrs.
Maitland-Fox at the Ghezireh Palace, whom
Lady Gardiner had met before, and from her she
gathered the crumbs of gossip with which she
immediately afterward regaled Virginia.</p>

<p>"They" said that the Countess de Mattos,
although she might really be a countess (and
there were those who pretended to vouch for
this), had scarcely a penny. She traded on her
beauty and the lovely clothes with which some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
trusting milliner must have supplied her, to
pick up rich or influential friends, from whom
she was certain to extort money in some way or
another. And it was Mrs. Maitland-Fox's
advice that Miss Beverly should be warned to
beware of the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>Among his friends, Roger heard something of
the same sort, and though he was bound to admit
that it was all very vague, he begged Virginia to
abandon a forlorn hope, and let the Portuguese
woman alone.</p>

<p>"If she were really a Portuguese woman she
might vanish from before my eyes, for all I
should care," obstinately returned the girl.
"But she is Liane Devereux, and if she breathed
poison I wouldn't let her go till I had torn out
her secret."</p>

<p>"How do you mean to set about doing that?"
demanded Roger.</p>

<p>"That is <i>my</i> secret," said Virginia. "Only
let me alone and don't thwart me, or you'll spoil
everything."</p>

<p>Roger waited, expectant and apprehensive.
He had not to wait long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE END OF THE WORLD</h3>


<p>They stayed a week in Cairo, and at the end
of that time the Countess de Mattos had
accepted an invitation to go yachting; not for
a day, but for a vague period of "dawdling," as
Virginia evasively expressed it. The beautiful
Portuguese woman had hesitated at first, and
confided to the American girl that, on account of
the delay in receiving an expected sum of money,
she did not quite see how she could get away in
time. But Virginia had begged the Countess
not to let such a small difficulty trouble her for a
moment. She really must accept a loan to tide
over the little annoyance; it would indeed be too
hard to lose the pleasure of her companionship
for the sake of a few paltry dollars, so that would
be no favour at all, or rather, the favour would be
the other way round.</p>

<p>The "few paltry dollars" necessary turned out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to be three thousand; but if they had been three
times three thousand Virginia would have lent
them just as cheerfully without the prospect of,
or even wish for, their return. With the money
obtained from Virginia's practically unlimited
letter of credit in her pocket, and a hint delicately
expressed that more would be at her service whenever
she wished, "as it was such a nuisance
having to keep in touch with one's bankers and
people like that on a long yachting trip when
nothing was less settled than one's plans," the
Countess thought herself very well off.</p>

<p>"Are you in a hurry to be anywhere in particular
during the next few weeks?" asked the
girl of her new friend. "No? How nice!
Then let us throw all the responsibility of planning
things upon the men. What fun never to
know where we are going, but to be surprised
always when we arrive anywhere."</p>

<p>And the Countess de Mattos agreed. She
would have agreed with almost anything that
Virginia said that day. If the American girl
believed that Providence had directed her to
cross the path of this beautiful woman, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
beautiful woman was equally sure that the god
of luck had put this infatuated young heiress in
her way.</p>

<p>Roger would hardly have consented to the
carrying out of Virginia's plan, which he called
"kidnapping," had George Trent not joined his
arguments to his sister's.</p>

<p>"It does seem a mad idea," he admitted,
"but if the woman isn't Liane Devereux, no
harm will be done, except that she'll be taken a
longer journey than she expects. If she is&mdash;ah!
I know what you think, old chap, without
your lifting your eyebrows up to your hair;
but, by Jove! Virgie's got an instinct that's
like the needle of a compass. When she says
'north,' I'd bet my bottom dollar it <i>was</i> north,
that's all. If I don't object to Virgie's associating
with the Countess, you needn't&mdash;yet,
anyhow. She isn't the kind of girl to be hurt
by that sort of thing, and, besides, she'll have
the dickens of a tantrum if we try to thwart her
now she's set her heart on this trick. She'd
be equal to slipping anchor with the Countess on
board and leaving us in the lurch. Let's see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the little girl through on her own lines, and if
the snap doesn't come off, she can't blame <i>us</i>.
Anyway, it's rougher on me than on you, for
Virgie's put me up to do the agreeable to the
Countess and keep her from getting restless
before we attempt to spring our mine. A while
ago I wouldn't have asked anything better than
flirting all day with such a woman, who is as
pretty and as fascinating as they're made,
but I'm not in the mood for it now, somehow.
Still, we're playing for big stakes&mdash;you for
yours, Roger, I for mine."</p>

<p>This was the only reference he made to his
interest in Madeleine Dalahaide; but Roger
guessed what was in his mind.</p>

<p>Lady Gardiner floundered deeper than ever
into the quicksands of mystery when she heard
that the Countess de Mattos was to be one of the
party for the rest of the voyage&mdash;wherever it
was to take them. What could be Virginia's
object in picking up this woman? Was it
really true that she had taken the violent and
sudden fancy to her that she feigned to feel,
or did that pretense cloak a hidden motive?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Kate had no clue, unless the fact that Virginia
had asked her never to mention Madeleine
Dalahaide or the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche before
the Countess could be called a motive. She would
have disobeyed Virginia, by way of a curiosity-satisfying
experiment, if she had not feared that
the result might be disastrous and that she would
be found out.</p>

<p>At least she would in a gentle, tactful way have
suggested objections to the Countess de Mattos's
presence on the yacht, had she not been certain
that Virginia would have frankly advised her
to stay behind if she did not like the arrangements
for the rest of the trip. Much as she
loved Cairo in the height of its gay season, much
as she hated the sea at all seasons, nevertheless
she was doggedly determined to see this adventure
to the end (bitter though it might be), not
only to earn her thousand pounds, but to know
the secret which actually kept her waking and
wondering at night.</p>

<p>It really was the strangest thing that Virginia
should want this adventuress on the yacht,
Kate indignantly remarked to Mrs. Maitland-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Fox.
The girl had refused to take a maid
because there would not be room, yet now she
dragged this creature on board to flirt with
George Trent and perhaps inveigle him into
a marriage under the impression that he was
as rich as he was handsome.</p>

<p>But with Virginia herself, after the first few
moments of surprise, Lady Gardiner had been
circumspect. She had not even dared to ask
the question burning on her lips&mdash;whether the
Countess would have the locked stateroom,
or what arrangement would be made for her
accommodation? Obliged to wait for this information
until the hour of going on board again,
once the Countess de Mattos's presence was to be
expected without hope of change, Kate began
to be impatient to start.</p>

<p>The party, counting quiet, keen-eyed little
Dr. Grayle, was now increased to six, an equal
number of men and women, for the Countess
had readily given up her maid. They all
travelled to Alexandria together one morning,
and, boarding the yacht, Kate eagerly watched
for the new guest to be taken to her stateroom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Would the locked door be opened? No; Virginia
led her past that mysterious, closed door,
to the cabin formerly occupied by George Trent,
and Kate saw that the young man's belongings,
just brought back from Cairo, had been set
down inside the stateroom once sacred to the
doctor alone. In this there were two berths,
and evidently George and the medical man
would "chum" together for the rest of the
voyage. The discovery did not add to Lady
Gardiner's love for the Portuguese woman, for,
half forgetting her uneasiness concerning Madeleine
Dalahaide, she was now jealous of the new
beauty, and it was gall and wormwood to Kate
that George Trent, lost to her, should be making
gallant sacrifices of his personal comfort for
another woman.</p>

<p>She had written to the Marchese Loria on the
first night of their arrival in Cairo, before the
acquaintance with the Countess had begun, and,
as she could learn nothing of the future programme
for the voyage, it had not seemed worth
while to write again. As for the invitation to
the Portuguese woman, Kate did not see that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
it could be of personal interest to Loria, and she
never wrote unless she had something to say
which was of importance to him; therefore the
Italian remained in ignorance that the Countess
de Mattos was a member of the little party on the
<i>Bella Cuba</i>.</p>

<p>So far as the trip had gone, there was nothing
to excite his anxiety save that the girl he coveted
for her beauty and her money was going farther
and farther from him. But one day a telegram
came for him to the Cap Martin Hotel, where he
still remained. It was dated from Port Said.
"Bound for Australia," were the three words
the message contained; and they were words of
heavy import to Loria.</p>

<p>Australia! There was no reason why Virginia
Beverly should not visit Australia. He had
heard her say that she would not be satisfied until
she had seen all the world. But if she had
thought of going to Australia before she left
Mentone, she had carefully refrained from saying
so. It was more the fact that she had concealed
such an intention than that she was now carrying
it out, which seemed ominous to Loria. Sydney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
was the nearest place of departure for New
Caledonia. In a Messageries mail boat it took
ten days to reach Noumea from Sydney; it
would perhaps take longer in a yacht like the
<i>Bella Cuba</i>. And the sensible question to ask
would be, Was it likely that a bright, erratic,
butterfly being like beautiful Virginia Beverly
would go so far simply for the pleasure of seeing
the prison which contained a stranger, a convicted
assassin for whom she had conceived a
girlishly romantic interest?</p>

<p>It was not as if she could hope to meet and
talk with Maxime Dalahaide himself, have the
pleasure of carrying him messages from his
sister, or perhaps even bring Madeleine to him
(for the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche was empty now,
in the hands of workmen, and no one, not even
Loria, had been able to learn where Mademoiselle
Dalahaide and her aunt had gone). The
Italian was not unlearned in such lore of
the far-away French prison-land as could be
obtained, and he had read that, though strangers
were allowed to land at Noumea, and a few had
been enabled through influence to penetrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
inside the prison walls, all personal intercourse
with the convicts was strictly interdicted. Since
the one almost miraculous escape, over thirty
years ago, of Henri Rochefort and Humbert,
watch and ward had been more strictly kept
than ever; besides, they had escaped from
Ducos, on the Isle of Pines, which in those
days had been sacred to political prisoners, and
discipline there had been, even then, lax compared
to that of the Ile Nou, the very heart
of prison-land, where Maxime Dalahaide was
dragging out the weary years of his lost life.</p>

<p>Yet what if Virginia should have formed the
extraordinary resolve of going to Noumea?
What was it to him&mdash;Loria&mdash;since she could
accomplish nothing there? Suppose, even, that
among other miserable convicts she saw Maxime&mdash;pallid,
thin, sullen and hopeless, his good
looks and his brilliant audacity crushed and gone&mdash;would
not the romantic feeling she had conceived
for him be instantly turned into horror
and disgust? When such a chill had withered
a girl's fancy for a man, there could be no future
blossoming, and her heart might be caught in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the rebound. Once, Loria had thought that
Virginia had been on the point of caring for him.
Perhaps when they met she would turn to him
again, remorseful for the pain she had caused,
grateful for his unwavering loyalty; and, telling
himself these things, he was almost persuaded
that it would do him more good than harm if
Virginia did go to Noumea. But he was never
wholly persuaded. A strange fear knocked
at his heart, a fear that had no name. He never
quite saw its face. Like a haunting ghost, it was
always behind him, and he could hear the swish
of its garments, the stealthy sound of its footfalls;
but when he turned upon it the thing was
gone, leaving only the impression of a black
shadow with a veiled face inexpressibly awful.</p>

<p>Loria could not sleep by night, and by day he
was restless. He began to dread an illness, and
was constantly troubled with headache, which
gave him an excuse for believing that the vague,
nervous apprehension he suffered was largely the
result of physical causes.</p>

<p>What else, indeed, could it be? He had
absolutely nothing to fear. Of this he was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
continually reminding himself, when another
telegram came from Lady Gardiner, dated
Sydney. "Leaving here to-morrow," she said.
"Destination unknown."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>Bella Cuba</i> was ten days out from Sydney
Heads. Her passengers rose early, for in the
morning it was good to be alive. Virginia,
fresh from her cold, salt bath, came on deck,
and saw the Countess de Mattos there, with
George Trent. Far away lay a strip of land, turning
slowly from violet to emerald as the yacht
steamed nearer. Virginia saw it and flushed. She
knew what it must be, and quickly she glanced at
George, with an eager question in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was tacitly understood that the task of
informing the Countess de Mattos what her
destination was to be must be left to Virginia;
she coveted it, while the two men did not. Still,
the Portuguese might have guessed, on seeing
that strip of violet; or George might inadvertently
have given her a clue, and she would be on
her guard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>But George's blue eyes met his sister's; and
with the faintest shake of his head he contrived
to convey to her the intelligence that the secret
still remained a secret.</p>

<p>Virginia's heart was beating fast as she joined
her brother and the Countess, and her hand was
not quite steady as she offered her field-glass to
the beautiful Portuguese, who had long ago
begged the two ladies on board to call her
"Manuela."</p>

<p>"What a large island!" exclaimed the
Countess. "And we seem to be making for it.
What can it be? Mr. Trent says perhaps it is
a mirage. But I think that is his joke. He likes
teasing."</p>

<p>"I think," replied Virginia calmly, though her
eyes were on the face of Manuela, "that we
must be coming in sight of New Caledonia."</p>

<p>As she gave this answer, Roger Broom came
up the companionway, and heard the last
words, which rang out, distinctly. Instantly he
knew that the moment for which Virginia had
been waiting was at hand, and he, too, watched
the Countess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>She had taken Virginia's field-glass, and was
gazing through it at the far-off land which with
each moment seemed to grow more distinct.
Only the delicate, aquiline profile could be seen
by the eager eyes that looked for a sign of
weakness. She did not speak at first, but a
visible shiver ran through her body. The field-glass
came down rather suddenly, and her fingers
gripped it tightly as they rested on the rail.
But she did not turn her face, and continued
gazing landward as at last she echoed the words,
"New Caledonia!"</p>

<p>"Is not that a prison for the French <i>for&ccedil;ats</i>?"
she slowly asked.</p>

<p>Tacitly, the two men left the answer to Virginia.
"Yes," said the girl. "Noumea is a
penal settlement. They say it is very interesting
to see. We thought that we might stop for a
day or two in the harbour there."</p>

<p>This time the Countess turned. "Oh, but
that would be terrible!" she exclaimed. "We&mdash;they
might rob and murder us, these convicts.
You did not say that we were coming
to Noumea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was to be one of our surprises," replied
Virginia. "I thought that you would like it."</p>

<p>"No, no!" ejaculated Manuela. "I do not
like it at all. I have a horror of such places and
such people. This is a pleasure trip, is it not?
There is no pleasure in visiting a prison-land.
Dear Virginia, dear Mr. Trent and Sir Roger,
do let us turn our faces another way and go
somewhere else."</p>

<p>Virginia had not lost a single changing shade
of expression on the Countess de Mattos's darkly
beautiful face; but if she had been questioned,
she would have had to confess that she was
disappointed in the great effect toward which
she had so long been working up. She had half
expected to see this wicked woman who, in some
deadly and mysterious way, had plotted to
destroy Maxime Dalahaide, turn livid under
the brown stain which she (Virginia) suspected,
gasp, totter, and perhaps fall fainting when she
heard those fatal names&mdash;"New Caledonia,
Noumea." But Manuela gave none of these
evidences of distress. If she paled, the dusky
stain in whose existence Virginia so tenaciously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
believed hid the sign of her emotion. It allowed
a deep flush to be seen; even Virginia could not
deny that, but pallor was difficult to trace where
complexion and even lips were tinted brown
and red; and the slight quivering of the body,
the dropping of the hand with the field-glass,
were not so marked that they might not be due
to an ordinary, disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you feel so about the place," said
Virginia. "That's the worst of planning surprises,
isn't it? One can't always be sure of
bringing off a success. Now, I'm afraid we
must make the best of it, for as we arranged to
come here, our stores won't last long enough to
avoid New Caledonia and go farther. We
must buy butter and milk and vegetables, and
chickens and lots of things, to say nothing of
coaling. But you needn't see anything of the
prison and the prisoners unless you like. The
harbour is said to be glorious, and you can stop
on board and read novels, while the rest of us do
our sight-seeing, which won't take us very long."</p>

<p>"Sight-seeing in a prison!" exclaimed the
Countess. "You English and Americans are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
strange. We Latins, we never give ourselves
pain that can be avoided. There is enough that
is unpleasant in life without that. Ugh! I
would rather do without butter and milk than
buy it of convicts, who may poison us in sheer
spite because we are more fortunate than they.
Could we not turn round, and get back to Sydney
without starving?"</p>

<p>"No, it couldn't be managed," said Virginia.</p>

<p>Manuela turned pleading eyes upon Roger
and George. They were men; they knew more
about such things than women; besides she
could usually make men do what she wished.
But for once she found creatures of the opposite
sex who were not to be melted by her pleading.
They agreed with Virginia that it was impossible
now to avoid New Caledonia.</p>

<p>"And how long shall we stay?" plaintively
inquired the Countess, when she had been
obliged to resign herself to the inevitable, which,
to her credit, she did with a very pretty grace.
"Shall we leave again to-night, with our poisoned
food?"</p>

<p>"Wait till you have seen the rocks in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
harbour," answered George. "If they're as
bad as the book says, they must be something
to see. Anyhow, it's only possible to get in or
out between sunrise and sunset. I'm afraid,
Countess, you'll have to put up with it till
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Manuela sighed a long sigh. She
asked no more questions, she made no more
protests. She turned her back upon New Caledonia,
and appeared to dismiss the land of lost
souls from her mind.</p>

<p>"Well," said Roger, when he and Virginia had
walked away, leaving the Countess and George
Trent to the flirtation which was so embittering
the daily life of Lady Gardiner. "Well, was I
right or wrong about this woman?"</p>

<p>"Wrong," firmly answered Virginia.</p>

<p>"You say that still, after the way she took your
<i>grand coup</i>? But this is only because you hate
giving up, beaten."</p>

<p>"I'm not beaten yet," the girl returned
doggedly. "I hoped for something different&mdash;yes,
I admit that. But her game means as
much to her as ours does to us. She's playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
it for all it's worth. If she weren't such a
wretch, I should have admired her pluck. How
she held her ground! Taken by surprise as she
was, almost her first thought was whether we
had purposely caught her in this trap, or whether
she had only an avenging fate to thank for such
a terrible and startling coincidence. I saw that,
at least, in her eyes and her face, Roger, though
I didn't see all I had been looking for. Think
what she must have been feeling! She helped
to send an innocent man who had loved and
trusted her into this exile, worse than death.
She thought herself free from him forever,
because he was at the other end of the world,
dead-alive, in the grave where she buried him.
Suddenly she finds herself looking at that grave,
unable to escape. At any moment it may open,
and the dead appear to accuse her. What a
situation!"</p>

<p>"What an imagination!" exclaimed Roger.
"Dear child, you have let it carry you away as
far from the truth as you've carried this woman
from her home&mdash;this woman whom you've
so audaciously kidnapped."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait," said Virginia, her voice trembling.
"I haven't done with her. This is only the first
turn of the thumbscrew. She doesn't dream
yet of the ordeal she'll have to go through."</p>

<p>"May have to go through," quietly amended
Roger Broom.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;oh, Roger, don't you think
we'll succeed in what we've come for so far, so
very far?"</p>

<p>Virginia, with tears sparkling in uplifted eyes,
was irresistible.</p>

<p>"I hope it, dear," the man who loved and
wanted her said, gravely. "I never thought it,
you know. But the way hasn't seemed far to
me, because I have been with you and the
time will not have been wasted for me if we fail,
because it has kept me by your side. I shall
think, 'I have done what I could, and it has
pleased Virginia.'"</p>

<p>"It has made Virginia grateful for all her life
long," said the girl softly, "and whatever happens
she will never forget. You have done so
much already! Disapproving my plan, still
you loyally did all you could to forward it. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
used your influence to get us the one chance here,
without which we could hope to do nothing.
You wrote to the French Ambassador in London,
the English Ambassador in France, and finally,
when our interests were so twisted up in masses
of official red-tape that it seemed they could
never get disentangled, you ran on to Paris
yourself to call on the Minister of the Colonies.
If it had not been for the permit you got from
him, we might as well have given up coming
here, for all the prison doors would have been
shut to us. Now, through him, and through
you, they will be open, and our first step is clear.
All this made me feel hopeful, when we were
far away; I felt sure that we should succeed.
But now that we have come these thousands
of miles in our poor little boat; now that we have
arrived at the end of the world and our real
work is still before us, my heart suddenly sinks
down&mdash;down. I'm frightened&mdash;I'm almost ill:
and your words and your face are so grave,
Roger! Your very tenderness and kindness
make it worse, for somehow, it's as if you
thought there might be a good-bye. It makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
me realize that, after all, the greatest danger
is to be run by you and George. You have
both come for my sake; and&mdash;you are going
to risk your lives."</p>

<p>"Risk your lives!" repeated a voice; and
turning quickly, Virginia and her cousin saw
Lady Gardiner, who had lately developed a
rather stealthy way of creeping noiselessly
behind her friends.</p>

<p>Virginia's mood was not one to promote
presence of mind. She was speechless; but
Roger stepped in to the breach.</p>

<p>"We were talking of a swim that George and I
propose to have in these pleasant waters," he
remarked. "There are supposed to be a good
many sharks about, and Virginia is advising
prudence."</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Lady Gardiner. "She is
quite right. We will all join our persuasions to
hers. But the Countess tells me this island is
actually New Caledonia, the French penal
settlement. Isn't that where your friend Miss
Dalahaide's brother is imprisoned?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," said Virginia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"How exciting! And how well you've kept
the secret of this expedition! Is there any
chance of our coming across the interesting
murderer?"</p>

<p>"Don't call him that!" Virginia cried hotly.
"How do you suppose that it would be possible
for us to come across him? Do tourists who
go to Portland 'come across' prisoners who
have been convicted of murder&mdash;whether innocent
or not? Noumea isn't the only port we
have visited. It is on our way. We shall stop
a day or two, and then&mdash;we shall go on somewhere
else."</p>

<p>"Quite so," drily returned Lady Gardiner.</p>

<p>It was noon when they slowly steamed into
the beautiful harbour of Noumea, and before
them lay the crime-cursed land, fair with the
fatal fairness of deadly nightshade.</p>

<p>There, for nearly five years, Maxime Dalahaide
had not lived, but existed. To give him
back to life, she had come thousands of miles
and spent more than twenty thousand pounds.
What would they find that he had become, if
those precious documents which Roger had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
obtained proved as potent as they hoped?
Would his brain and heart have been strong
enough to bear the hopeless agony, the shame,
the hideous associations of those years which
to him must have seemed a century of despair;
or would he have fallen under the burden?</p>

<p>Virginia shivered as if with cold, as she
fancied a hard, official voice announcing that
Number So-and-So was dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GATES OPEN</h3>


<p>The Countess de Mattos had a headache
which was so severe, she announced,
that it would prevent her from landing; besides,
she was not interested in convicts. Lady Gardiner,
on the contrary, was greatly interested.
Never had she been more alert; never had her
black eyes been so keen. She wanted to go
everywhere; she wanted to see everything.
She thought Noumea a charming place; she
had "really <i>no</i> sympathy for the prisoners."
One might commit a crime solely for the pleasure
of being sent here.</p>

<p>The party of five went ashore, and Kate's
principal preoccupation seemed to be to keep
as close to Virginia as possible. She had the
air of expecting some choice excitement, which
she might miss if the girl were lost sight of for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>a moment. But nothing in the manner of Virginia
or her brother or cousin suggested that
they had come to this strange spot "at the end
of the world" with any object save that of
amusement. They behaved just as they had
behaved at Sydney, or any other port at which
they had called. All five strolled up, under a
blaze of tropical sunshine, to the Place des
Cocotiers, and sitting on the shaded verandah
of the H&ocirc;tel de France, sipped a cooling drink
concocted of oranges, lemons and pineapple.
Then they sauntered on again, much observed
by a few weary-looking persons they met,
through broad streets, with long, low, white
houses.</p>

<p>Dr. Grayle kept beside Lady Gardiner now,
and they walked in front, as the former was
supposed to have studied the subject of the
penal settlement so thoroughly as to be qualified
for guide.</p>

<p>Kate glanced over her shoulder often; but
Dr. Grayle succeeded in genuinely interesting
her in a story of an atrocious criminal who
had been expatriated to Noumea some years
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>before. When she looked hurriedly back, ostensibly
to ask Roger Broom if he had ever heard
the spicy narrative, the three had disappeared.</p>

<p>Lady Gardiner flushed in anger with them
for their duplicity, with herself for her carelessness
in letting them slip away. "Dear me!
what <i>has</i> become of the others?" she exclaimed.
"We must turn back and find them."</p>

<p>Dr. Grayle took the defection calmly&mdash;so
calmly that Kate leaped to the conviction that
he was in the plot against her. The others
wanted to go somewhere or do something
without her, and this little brown-faced, sharp-eyed
man had been told off as a kind of decoy
duck. But she would circumvent them yet.
She <i>would</i> know what was going on.</p>

<p>"They have probably gone to buy some bit
of carving or other souvenirs of convict make,"
said the doctor. "Certainly we'll turn back if
you like."</p>

<p>They did turn back, and wandered about in
all the (according to Dr. Grayle) most likely
places to find the lost ones, but in vain. Kate
could have burst into tears of rage. She was
hot, tired, dusty, and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;thwarted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
It was hateful to feel herself helpless in the plotters'
hands, being made to dance when they
pulled the strings, and to know that this "horrid
little brown man" was secretly laughing at her
behind his polite air of concern. Yet she <i>was</i>
helpless, and had to acknowledge it. If she
left the doctor and went off on an expedition
of independent exploration she would not know
which way to go, and might get into trouble.
But at last she could no longer bear her wrongs
in silence; and, after all, she had nothing to
gain by being nice to Dr. Grayle.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think," she burst out angrily,
"that you are making a fool of me, and that I
don't know it. But I'm not as simple as you
seem to believe. I'm perfectly well aware that
there's a mystery going on, and that all these
elaborate precautions are to keep me out of it."</p>

<p>Dr. Grayle raised his eyebrows. "Then you
are much more enlightened than I am," he
returned mildly. "I'm really quite at loss to
know what you mean, Lady Gardiner."</p>

<p>"In plain words, I mean that you are walking
me off my feet to cover the others' escape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
You know perfectly well where they are, but
they've ordered you to keep out of the way,
and you are doing as you're told, like a nice,
obedient little man. I never was so abominably
treated in my life."</p>

<p>"I can't see, even if Miss Beverly and her two
relations choose to go off for a little private
sight-seeing on their own account, that either
you or I have anything to complain of," said the
doctor. "We are outsiders, and are both very
well paid for our services. My opinion is that
few persons in our position receive as much
consideration from their employers as we do."</p>

<p>Kate was so furious at this snub (which
found a vital spot) that she was literally speechless
for a moment. She would have liked to
strike the impertinent little wretch who dared
put her on a level with himself; but she could
hardly do that, even in Noumea. When the
wave of angry blood flowed back from her brain,
and she recovered presence of mind, she turned
abruptly and walked away from the doctor.
But he was at her side again almost immediately,
keeping up with her without any appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of haste, though she quickened her pace in spite
of fatigue, looking as cool, as serene, as if he
had been taking an afternoon stroll in Bond
Street. Evidently he had torn a leaf out of
Roger Broom's book; and Kate recalled the
forgotten fact that it was Roger who had recommended
him to Virginia's notice.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "but you are
now going toward that part of the town which
was burnt down at the time of the plague here,
about three years ago. It is leading you rather
out of the way of the hotel, where we were all to
meet for luncheon; but perhaps you have a
curiosity to see it? I have studied a map of the
place, and if you like can point out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not like!" Lady Gardiner cut in sharply.
"I wish to send a cablegram."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, that is impossible."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i> One can't telegraph from this loathsome
place?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were so charmed with it?
One cannot telegraph to-day."</p>

<p>"Why not to-day? Is it a holiday for the
operators?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"So far as we are concerned."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see what you mean now. You
intend to prevent my communicating with my
friends! But this is too much. I will do so."</p>

<p>"I fancied you were attached to Miss Beverly."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"A good deal. We are Miss Beverly's guests&mdash;or
her servants, whichever you please. In
either case, we surely owe her fealty. I have
been informed that she does not wish to have any
communication made with the outside world,
from Noumea."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was not informed of this mandate."</p>

<p>"I dare say she thought that you would be
guided by my counsel."</p>

<p>"Counsel! A strange word for your tyranny.
At least, I suppose, there are no orders against
returning to the hotel?"</p>

<p>"None. So long as we are discreet."</p>

<p>"And in what does your idea of discretion
consist, pray?"</p>

<p>"Keeping ourselves to ourselves. They are
rather suspicious folk in New Caledonia. Few
tourists come this way. Probably we are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
first people who have landed here not on business
for many a long year."</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure that we haven't come on
business&mdash;very particular business."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't make that remark before anybody
else, if I were you. You might&mdash;get into
trouble."</p>

<p>As Dr. Grayle said this he looked steadily at
Lady Gardiner. Their eyes met, and so peculiarly
cold and menacing was the expression of
his that she felt unpleasantly chilled, and even
subdued. Those steady eyes so underscored his
words with sinister meaning, that Kate dared not
ask whether the "trouble" to which he suggestively
referred would come to her through
him or the inhabitants of Noumea. She thought
that he looked capable of reducing her to helplessness
by violence, if she showed signs of
resisting his will, and she relapsed into silence.
But she had not given up the hope of cabling to
Loria. She resolved to watch her chance.</p>

<p>They walked back to the H&ocirc;tel de France, but
the others had not returned, though the time
fixed was long past. Kate was so hungry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
weary that again she could have wept, and was
secretly glad when Dr. Grayle ordered luncheon
for two, though the prospect of a meal <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
was not enjoyable. She complained, however,
of being too warm and dusty to eat, unless she
could refresh herself by splashing a little in
cold water, and she had to look down to hide
the light which flashed into her eyes when Grayle
consented without protest to her taking a room,
and re-making her toilet before lunch.</p>

<p>"Now I shall get off that cable," she said to
herself. Hardly had she entered the bare,
poorly furnished bedroom when she rang, and
stood waiting eagerly for a servant to answer
the summons. Presently came the expected
knock. She flew to open the door, and&mdash;there
stood the little doctor, behind him approaching a
maid, probably an ex-convict.</p>

<p>"You rang, Lady Gardiner," said Dr. Grayle,
"to ask for a telegraph form, just as you might
in a civilized place, didn't you? But this isn't
a civilized place, and the methods are not all
civilized. Now, here is the servant you rang for.
If you persist in carrying out your intention I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
shall lock you in this room, take the key, and tell
the landlord that you are a harmless lunatic,
under my medical supervision. I think I shall
not in that case lack for assistance in keeping you
within bounds."</p>

<p>Kate glared at him, panting, for a moment.
Then, controlling her voice, she asked the
servant in French for some hot water. Having
done this, she slammed the door in the little
man's face, which was the only satisfaction she
got out of the incident. She was inclined to
remain sulking in the bedroom, but though the
spirit was willing the flesh was weak, and the
pangs of hunger drove her forth. Dr. Grayle
was awaiting her in the corridor, a watchdog,
patient and placid.</p>


<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The missing three did no more aimless
sauntering after they had slipped round a corner
and eluded Kate Gardiner's curious eyes. Had
their business not been of life-and-death importance,
they would have felt like children escaped
from school; since the least imprudence might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
lose them the stake for which they played, and
Kate's presence had been a check and cause of
delay. Fortunately, it was not yet the hour of
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, even in Noumea, and they made up
for lost time by hastening to the Governor's
offices, which were in a white-painted, two-story
building of wood, with a verandah facing the
almost deserted street.</p>

<p>It was Sir Roger Broom who had used his
influence in obtaining a special letter from the
Minister of Colonies to the Governor of New
Caledonia, and he now sent it in with his card,
and those of his friends, by a clerk. For a few
moments they waited, soldiers in gay uniforms,
gendarmes and convict messengers passing in
and out on various errands, all gazing with
surprised, if furtive, interest at the extraordinarily
beautiful girl in white. Presently the
Governor was ready to receive his guests, and
his turn came to be astonished by Virginia.
She was the first lady who had ever come to
Noumea, he said, on a journey of pleasure.
Ah, the American young ladies, they were
wonderful, amazing! He asked a few questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
about the yacht, the trip they had had, and his
old friend the Minister of Colonies, then countersigned
the credentials for the party, and dashed
off a letter to the Director of the Penitentiary
Administration.</p>

<p>It was upon the latter official that everything
depended. So far all was satisfactory; but if
the Director (who was supreme in authority
over the prison, not answerable even to the
Governor) chose to be ungracious, they might go
back whence they had come without even
attempting that bold stroke in the hope of which
they had paid this visit. They had dared,
however, show no signs of their consuming
anxiety. With smiling thanks they bade good-bye
to the Governor and went on, in the fitful
silence of suspense, to the Direction.</p>

<p>Again the letters and cards were borne away
by a clerk. There was more waiting; and when
they were ushered into a large, cool, dusky
room, strangely still behind its heavy double
doors, Virginia was glad of the gloom, lest her
pallor should excite suspicion.</p>

<p>Afterward Roger and George said to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
other that if it had not been for Virginia they
believed the Director would have politely, but
firmly, refused to grant the special privileges
they craved. Others had received ordinary
permits to "view" the penitentiary establishment,
yet very few, indeed (save those who went
because they must), had been suffered by the
authorities to pass the prison gates. But what
Frenchman could refuse any favour in his power
to the all-conquering Virginia? The Director
would have been well within his rights, and could
not have been accused of discourtesy, if he
had allowed a certain short, concise sentence at
the left-hand corner of the official sheet of paper
which he signed, to remain. But instead he
scratched it out with two quick strokes of the
pen; and the doors of the prison and its cells
were practically thrown open.</p>

<p>He, too, asked questions, and seemed wistfully
loth to part with these interesting visitors
from a far-away world, whose echoes he seldom
heard. He smiled indulgently when Virginia
fluently told the story prepared beforehand:
the book she and her brother had been com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>missioned
to write by a prominent American
publishing firm; how it was to be all about this
yachting trip, with Noumea as the <i>pi&egrave;ce de
resistance</i> of the story. They expected, George
Trent chimed in by saying, to stop on board
their yacht in the harbour for a day or two
perhaps, but (and he made the most of his
engaging Southern accent) what they particularly
wanted was to "do" the Ile Nou, which
all the books said was so "mighty" interesting.</p>

<p>The Director obligingly scrawled a letter to
the Commandant of the prison in New Caledonia,
explained to his guests what they must
do, and cordially invited them to lunch with him.
The thought of eating was repulsive to Virginia;
but Roger telegraphed her a warning look, and
she knew that she must accept. It would not be
wise to let it be seen that they were in a hurry;
they were eccentric pleasure-seekers, sea-tourists;
to be in haste was to throw aside disguise.</p>

<p>After <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, which seemed interminable,
they were allowed to depart. So to a group of
white, gray-roofed buildings set in brilliant little
squares of garden&mdash;the offices of the executive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
police. Passing on, they reached a small wooden
quay, belonging to the penitential administration.
Men in ugly gray clothing, their faces shaded
with broad, ribbonless straw hats, were working
at loading a boat with large boxes, which they
carried to the quay from a truck on a miniature
local railway line. These men were directed in
their labour by other men in white; and Virginia
shivered all over, for this was her first sight of the
convicts. What if Maxime Dalahaide were among
these forlorn wretches who toiled and sweated
in the blazing sun, with no encouragement save
the rough exhortations of the white-clad surveillants
with revolvers on their hips? If he were
here, did any voice whisper to him of hope?</p>

<p>The <i>canot</i> for the Ile Nou was to start almost
immediately. The credentials of the party were
examined at the <i>douanerie</i>, and they were permitted
to go on board. Twelve convicts were
the rowers. They sat under an awning which
protected them as well as the passengers from
the sun, but Virginia, glancing almost fearfully
at their faces, saw that their skins were tanned
to the colour of mahogany by exposure. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
features were, without one exception, marked
with the indefinable yet not-to-be-mistaken
stamp of criminality, and she breathed more
freely when she had assured herself that the
man they sought was not one of them.</p>

<p>All they had to go upon was the vague information
derived from Madeleine Dalahaide, that her
brother was supposed to be on the Ile Nou. The
time had not come yet to ask the questions that
burnt their tongues; but it was coming nearer
now with each wide sweep of the convicts' oars.</p>

<p>The Director had been thoughtful enough to
telegraph to the Ile Nou of the visitors' arrival,
and as the <i>canot</i> approached the quay of the
strange little settlement, an officer of the prison,
who had the appearance of a superior warder,
stepped forward, touching his white hat.</p>

<p>Virginia felt, with a thickly beating heart, that
the long preface was finished, the first chapter of
the book about to begin. She looked at this
island of exile and punishment with an emotion
that was not curiosity, but which could be classified
by no other word. The Ile Nou was not to
the eye the terrible place of which she had so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
often dreamt. There were more low, white
houses, clustering cosily together or separated by
thick, dark trees, and there were shaded streets
and more blazing <i>flamboyant</i> flowers making
patches of red in the deep green. But beyond
the town rose a hill, and there the great prison
buildings stood out grimly against the cloudless
blue of the tropical sky.</p>

<p>They landed. The warder begged them with
French politeness to give themselves the trouble
of accompanying him to the quarters of the
Commandant, who expected their visit.</p>

<p>The programme of conspiracy was all planned;
each one's part had been carefully mapped out,
and a thousand times Virginia had gone through
the ordeal of this day in her mind. Yet now the
beating in her temples confused her thoughts.
She was afraid that she should forget, that she
should make some irretrievable blunder, and that
everything would be ruined by her fault. But
much might depend now upon a look or a gesture,
and she held herself in a vice of self-control,
fearing that her smile on greeting the courteous
old Commandant was suspiciously forced, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
voice unnatural, or the look in her eyes a
betrayal of desperate anxiety.</p>

<p>But the gallant Frenchman saw only the most
entrancing vision of a girl his eyes had ever
looked upon. Within the bounds of reason&mdash;which
meant in honour and within the regulations
of the establishment&mdash;he would have
done anything to win one of those distracting
smiles which brought into play two little round
dimples. He ordered his own carriage to take
his guests to the grim hill behind the town; he
sat by Virginia as they were driven up the white,
winding road; and when at last the convict
coachman drew up the horses at a great door
of black iron in the blank side of a high white
wall, it was he who helped her to alight.</p>

<p>"You will be the only lady, not the wife or
daughter of an official of the place, who has ever
entered at this gate, mademoiselle," he remarked
as the key of the surveillant grated in the lock.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Virginia passed through,
trembling, the Commandant at her side. They
were in a long, oddly-shaped courtyard. "The
place of execution," said her guide. "In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
early morning, at sunrise, a condemned man is
brought here to die by the guillotine. Through
that door yonder he comes, the priest walking by
his side. To-morrow there will be such an
execution. But I suppose you would scarcely
care to see that, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" exclaimed Virginia, shuddering.
"I would die myself, sooner. What has he
done&mdash;this unfortunate one&mdash;that he must
suffer death?"</p>

<p>"He attempted to escape&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;you kill them for that, if&mdash;they are
retaken?"</p>

<p>"No; but wait, mademoiselle. I will tell you
the story. It may be of use as an anecdote for
the book you will write. This man who is to die
to-morrow morning, and who will not know that
his time has come until the knock at the door of
his cell when the hour strikes&mdash;this man and
another, who were imprisoned at the Isle of
Pines, stole a small open fishing-boat, and with
the branch of a tree for a mast and a shirt for a
sail, started out in the desperate hope of eventually
reaching Australia. But the alarm was soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
given, and they were pursued by such a <i>canot</i> as
that in which you came here, mademoiselle, from
Noumea. One of the fugitives was mad enough
to jump from the boat, scarcely knowing what he
did. In a moment he had ceased to live."</p>

<p>"He was shot?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, mademoiselle. The waters here are
literally alive with sharks. Bathing even near
shore is dangerous. A little farther out&mdash;but
I will say no more. You grow pale."</p>

<p>"That is nothing. And the other man&mdash;what
of him?"</p>

<p>"He was captured; but he is a young, athletic
fellow, and in his fury at being retaken he
snatched a surveillant's revolver and shot him
dead. He was tried, condemned to death, and
to-morrow at sunrise, as I said, will expiate his
crime and folly."</p>

<p>Virginia was very white now&mdash;almost as white
as the frock which she had chosen from her prettiest
for the subjugation of these men in authority.</p>

<p>"What is the man's name?" she ventured to
ask, her voice sounding strange and metallic
in her own ears, her lips dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>NUMBER 1280</h3>


<p>"The man is without a name," said the
Commandant. "He is a number. But
once he was known as Jean Fourneau."</p>

<p>Virginia breathed again. "And the one who
was with him?"</p>

<p>"The man eaten by the sharks? He was
called, in the world, Pierre Duval."</p>

<p>The girl could hardly restrain a murmur of
the infinite relief she felt. But she dared show
no emotion. "I suppose you have all sorts
and conditions of men here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"From the highest to the lowest."</p>

<p>"Then there must be many interesting cases&mdash;quite
romances. Do tell us something about
a few of the best."</p>

<p>"That is difficult. There are many cases
which might interest you; but they would shock
you as well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would trust you to choose. Have you
any young men of good family who, perhaps,
committed their crimes for love?"</p>

<p>The Commandant smiled. "We have many
such. There is the man who is called the New
Caledonian Dreyfus&mdash;Chatelain&mdash;who sold
his country to please the woman he loved. He
is at Ducos. But perhaps the most notable
example of the type you desire is a young scion
of French and English aristocracy whom we
have here, on the Ile Nou. He is now
known as Number 1280; but a few years
ago he figured brilliantly in the great world
as Maxime Dalahaide. You may have heard
of him, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>The words rang strangely in the girl's ears.
She "might have heard of him"! But her
presence of mind had not left her, as a few
moments ago she had feared it might, when it
should be needed most.</p>

<p>She was simply carrying out her part of
the programme, and she knew that Roger
and George were watching her from behind
half-closed lids. If they could help her they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
would; but the time had not come for their
help yet.</p>

<p>"I left America only a year ago," she
answered, "and one forgets things of this sort
when they happen very far away."</p>

<p>"Naturally. But it was an uncommon case.
Maxime Dalahaide was condemned to death for
murdering a beautiful young actress, with
whom he was in love&mdash;jealousy alleged as the
cause. However, powerful influence saved him
from death and sent him to us. I do not know
that he was properly thankful."</p>

<p>Virginia showed a little decorous interest,
such as a stranger might legitimately take in
the hero of such a tale. "This story ought
to make a splendid anecdote for our book,"
she exclaimed. "Is the man handsome?"</p>

<p>"You might not think so if you saw him now.
The costume of the <i>for&ccedil;at</i> is not becoming. But
he is still quite young, between twenty-eight
and nine. You can see his portrait if you
like, mademoiselle, at the Bureau of Anthropometry,
where each convict's photograph
is taken, with every possible view of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
face, when he first becomes an inmate of
the prison."</p>

<p>"I would rather see the man himself," answered
Virginia. "If you would <i>only</i> let my
brother and me have an interview with him;
think how it would help our book! Ah, monsieur,
that <i>would</i> be kind. I should never forget
your goodness in giving me such a chance."</p>

<p>The gallant Commandant hesitated. But&mdash;the
permit in the possession of these three
favoured visitors was very explicit. They were
to have privileges scarcely ever granted before,
and he had therefore the best of excuses for
obliging the beautiful American girl.</p>

<p>"Do say yes!" persuasively added Virginia.</p>

<p>"I really think I may conscientiously do so,"
replied the old Frenchman, delighted to please
the most radiant being he had seen for many
a long year. "Number 1280 has acted for
some time as secretary in one of the bureaux;
but another convict, displaced for Dalahaide
because of carelessness and inaccuracy, was
jealous of the favour shown the aristocrat (ah,
I assure you they know all about each other's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
affairs and circumstances here!), contrived to
make a rough knife out of a piece of flint, and
stabbed his rival in the back, narrowly missing
the lungs. As it was, the wound was a serious
one, and Dalahaide is in the hospital. The
would-be murderer is now undergoing punishment
in what we call the Black Cell."</p>

<p>"The wound was not actually dangerous?"
Roger hastened to inquire, seeing that Virginia's
lips were white.</p>

<p>"He ought not to be dangerously ill," said
the Commandant. "He is young, and quite
one of our athletes&mdash;or was. The life he had
led here, though not what he would choose, has
not been unhealthful. But the doctor, with
whom I have discussed his case, says that the
wish to recover is lacking. The man is hopeless.
He would rather die than live; and his physician
thinks it exceedingly likely that he will do so."</p>

<p>"That is sad," said Sir Roger, his eyes still
on Virginia.</p>

<p>The Commandant shrugged his shoulders.
"We are accustomed to sadness here," he
replied. "But the exile and degradation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Noumea are no doubt harder of endurance to a
man like Dalahaide&mdash;proud, sensitive, refined,
intellectual, accustomed to every luxury. He
was like a madman when he first came, four or
five years ago. Several times he attempted
escape and suicide. Then he became sullenly
despairing; but I began to take an interest in
him, believing that he was not at bottom such
a desperate character as the surveillants had
grown to consider him. I did what I could to
soften his lot, having him introduced to more
congenial work in the bureau; but this was not
until he had known three months in the Black
Cell. Some men lose their minds in the <i>Cachot
Noir</i>, though its horrors have been mitigated
of late years. But Dalahaide's brain did not
fail; and he has proved a valuable man at
secretarial work. Also during the plague, three
years ago, he volunteered as a nurse, and was
admirable. You shall see him in hospital,
since you wish it, and even talk with him; but
you must not leave New Caledonia with the
impression that all convicts are like this man.
Now we will finish the inspection of the prison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
here, and then my carriage shall drive us to the
hospital, which is at a little distance."</p>

<p>How Virginia got through the next half-hour
she did not know. If she had dared, she would
have begged to go on at once to the hospital;
but she did not dare. It was necessary to submit
to the delay of being guided through the
prison, to be shown the galleries and the cells,
the Pr&eacute;toire, and to hear patiently the explanation
of the Bertillon system. At last, however,
they were once more in the carriage which had
been kept waiting for them; but even then they
must still exercise patience, for a Disciplinary
Camp was on the road along which they must
pass, and to betray too much eagerness to reach
their journey's end (when avowedly they had
come to New Caledonia for information) would
have been dangerous. At the camp they must
perforce squander twenty or thirty minutes,
Virginia and George pretending to take notes
of what they saw and heard; and then they
turned westward. Before them stretched a
long avenue of strangely bent and sloping palms.
It was the avenue of the hospital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>They drove down it to a stone archway,
glittering white in the sun, and saw beyond a
green and shaded garden, jewelled with gorgeous
flowers, and heavy with richly mingling
scents.</p>

<p>"If Dalahaide is no worse to-day, we shall
probably find him in the garden here," said the
Commandant. "He must have read at least
half a dozen times an old copy of Dante which
I lent him; the books in the prison library are
not much to his taste."</p>

<p>No one answered, not even Roger. In fact,
at the moment Roger was more anxious, perhaps,
than any other member of the party, for
he realized the existence of a certain danger
which Virginia and her brother had apparently
lost sight of, although long ago it had been
discussed by them all. It had also been provided
against; but the suggestion that Maxime
Dalahaide might be met here in the garden,
the thought that at any moment they might
come upon him suddenly and unexpectedly,
upset these prudent calculations.</p>

<p>As Maxime and Roger had known each other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
five years ago, it had been decided that a meeting
must be avoided at first, lest in his surprise at
seeing a familiar face&mdash;like a ghost from
another world&mdash;the prisoner should cry out,
and involuntarily put those who watched upon
their guard. The three had planned among
themselves, when this day was still in the future,
that if they should succeed in their first step,
and gain access to Maxime Dalahaide, Roger
must keep in the background until his mind
had been prepared by Virginia and George
Trent for what was to come. The other two,
as strangers to him, could approach the prisoner
without risk. But they had expected to see him,
if at all, in some room or cell, to which certain
members of the party might be conducted by
request; while here, in this vast garden, with its
ambushes of trees and shrubs, any one of the
half-hidden gray figures which they could
distinguish in the green shadows might prove
to be Dalahaide.</p>

<p>Roger did not know what to do. He might
offer to stop behind and wait in the carriage
outside the garden gates. But if he did this it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
would seem strange and even ungracious to the
Commandant, who was taking so much trouble
to entertain them, and to "seem strange" was
alone enough to constitute danger. He compromised,
keeping behind with George, while
Virginia walked ahead with the old Frenchman.</p>

<p>In the midst of the garden stood the quadrangular
building of the hospital, the steep roof
forming broad verandahs. There were gray
figures sitting or lounging there also, but the
Commandant said that Number 1280 would not
be found among these, for he fled as much as
might be from the society of his fellow-convicts.</p>

<p>They turned the corner of a shaded path and
came out under a green canopy made by four
large palms. A man lay underneath, his head
pillowed on his arm, his face upturned&mdash;a
man in the sordid prison gray. Virginia Beverly
grew giddy, and, brave as she had been so far,
for an instant she feared that she was going to
faint like an ordinary, stay-at-home girl. She
started, and caught at the arm of the Commandant,
who turned to her in concerned
surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"One would think you had guessed that this
was our man," he said in a low voice, for the
convict, whose face was ghastly pale in the green
dusk, seemed to sleep.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," whispered Virginia.
"I stepped on a stone and twisted my foot. Is
this, then, the man we have come to find?"</p>

<p>How well she knew that it was he! How
well she knew, though the terrible years had
changed the brave young face in the portrait
almost beyond the recognition of a stranger.
All the gay audacity was gone, therefore much
of the individuality which had distinguished it
for Virginia. The strong, clear features of the
man looked, as he lay there asleep, as if they
had been carved from old ivory; the lines were
sharpened, there were hollows in the cheeks
and under the black lines of the lashes. Even
in sleep the dark brows were drawn together in
a slight frown, and the clean-cut lips drooped
in unutterable melancholy. The figure, lying
on its back and extended along the grass,
appeared very tall, and lay so still that it might
have been the form of a dead man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger, without seeing the sleeping face,
guessed by the abrupt stop and the low-spoken
words of the two in front that Maxime Dalahaide
was found. He drew back slightly, with
a meaning glance at George, who stepped forward
to join the others.</p>

<p>Suddenly the black line of lashes trembled;
a pair of dark, tragic eyes, more like those of
Madeleine Dalahaide than the laughing ones
of the portrait, opened and looked straight into
Virginia's. For a few seconds their gaze
remained fixed, as if the white vision had been
a broken dream; then a deep flush spread over
the thin face of the young man, and he rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>"This lady and her brother have come a
long way to see New Caledonia," said the
Commandant kindly. "They wish to talk to
you."</p>

<p>Maxime Dalahaide bowed. Virginia saw that
he pressed his lips together, and that the muscles
of his face quivered. She guessed how he must
suffer at having to gratify&mdash;as he supposed&mdash;the
morbid curiosity of a girl, and it hurt her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to think that she must be the one to give him
this added pain.</p>

<p>She turned to the Commandant, and, with
a voice not quite steady, asked if she and her
brother might speak to the man alone. She
felt that she should be less embarrassed in her
questions, she said, if no one listened. With a
smile the old Frenchman consented, bowing
like a courtier, and joined Roger Broom, who
stood at a little distance out of sight of the
convict.</p>

<p>"I thought there was no use embarrassing
the poor fellow with any more strangers,"
Roger explained to the Commandant, as they
moved further away down the path by which
they had come. "After all, my place in this
expedition is only to take a few photographs,
wherever they are permitted"; and he touched
the camera, slung over his shoulder, of which
he had already made ostentatious use on several
occasions. "May I have a snapshot of the
hospital, with all those chaps on the verandahs?
Thanks; we must go a little to the right, then.
By Jove! what a lot of gray figures there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
about. How do you make sure they can't
escape, if they choose, out here where they don't
seem to be guarded?"</p>

<p>"It is only 'seem,'" retorted the Commandant,
laughing. "All these men are invalids;
we make short work of malingerers.
Very few could run a dozen yards without falling
down, and most of them are well contented
as they are. But, if any one should be mad
enough to attempt a dash for freedom, four or
five surveillants would be on him before he
could count twenty. They do not make themselves
conspicuous here, that is all."</p>

<p>Sir Roger Broom looked across the eastern
wall of the hospital garden, over the green
expanse of the great lagoon, and thought much;
but he said nothing. Quietly he prepared to
take the suggested photograph, and the hand
that held the camera did not shake, though he
could guess of what, by this time, George Trent
and Virginia were talking with the convict
under the palms.</p>

<p>When the Commandant had left them alone
with him, Maxime Dalahaide remained silent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Virginia's beauty filled him&mdash;not with happy
worship of its perfection, but rather with an
overwhelming bitterness. He was a Thing, of
whom this exquisite, fresh young girl wished to
ask a few questions, so that she might go back
to her world, thousands of miles away, and say,
"Only fancy, I talked to one of the convicts&mdash;an
awful creature. He had murdered a woman,
but he was quite quiet, and, as my brother was
close beside me, I was not one bit afraid."</p>

<p>Just because he was a Thing, with no right
to pride and self-respect, she could ask what
she pleased, and he would answer her; but she
must begin, not he.</p>

<p>She did begin, yet so differently from the
cut-and-dried beginning which he had scornfully
expected, that a flash of vivid amazement swept
the hardness from the exile's face.</p>

<p>"Be very careful," she said rapidly in English.
"Don't speak, don't show anything you may
feel. Perhaps we are watched. You are Maxime
Dalahaide. We haven't come here for
curiosity, as you think, but to save you. We
have come thousands of miles for that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" It was as if the question fell from
his lips without volition. The man did not
believe his own ears. He thought that he must
have been seized with delirium.</p>

<p>"Because we believe in you and because we
are friends of your sister's," Virginia answered.
"A man you once knew is with us&mdash;Roger
Broom. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Roger Broom!" Maxime repeated dazedly.
"It is like an echo from the past. Yes&mdash;yes, I
remember."</p>

<p>"It is through him that we have been able to
reach you. He is close by, but dared not let you
see him, until you had been warned. Now, we
must arrange everything in a few minutes for
your escape; the Commandant has been kind,
but he may not give us long together."</p>

<p>"I think I must be dreaming," stammered
Maxime, all his bitterness forgotten. "I've
been ill. I don't understand things as quickly
as I used. Escape! You have come here to&mdash;help
me to escape. Yes, it is certainly a
dream. I shall wake up by and by!"</p>

<p>"You will wake up free," said Virginia not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
daring to raise her voice above a low monotone.
"Free, on our yacht, that has brought us from
France to take you home."</p>

<p>Suddenly a glaze of tears overspread Maxime
Dalahaide's dark eyes. "Home?" he echoed
wistfully. "Home! Ah, if it might be!"</p>

<p>"It shall be," returned Virginia. "George, tell
him our plan. You can do it better than I."</p>

<p>"The thing is to get you on board the yacht,"
said Trent. "After that, you're all right. We
can show our heels to pretty well anything in
these parts."</p>

<p>Dalahaide shook his head. "There are no
words to thank you for what you have done, and
would do for me," he answered. "But it is
impossible. Once I thought of escape. I tried
and failed, as others have tried and failed. After
the second time, they put me in the Black Cell,
and I saved myself from madness by calling to
memory all of Shakespeare that I had ever
learned. I don't say 'impossible' because I am
afraid of that again. I have passed beyond
fear of anything. What have I left to dread? I
know the worst; I have lived through the worst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
that can befall a man. But in that dreadful
blackness, where my very soul seemed to dissolve
in night, I realized that, even if I could
escape, how useless freedom would be if my
innocence were not proved. I could not go to
France or England. I should live a hunted
life. As well be an exile here as nearer home&mdash;better,
perhaps, now that the first bitterness
has passed."</p>

<p>"You think this because you've been ill, and
your blood runs slow," said George Trent. "All
you need is to be strong again, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Strong again!" echoed Maxime, with sorrowful
contempt. "I've been thanking heaven
that I hadn't strength enough left to care for anything.
It's true, as you say; the oil in my lamp
of life burns low, and so much the better for me.
What I want now is to get it all over as soon
as may be. You are kind&mdash;you are so good
to me that I am lost in wonder; yet even you
cannot give me a freedom worth having. Take
back my love to my sister, but tell her&mdash;tell
her that I am content to stay as I am."</p>

<p>"Content to die, you mean!" cried Virginia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you are ill indeed to feel like this. How
can you bear to stay here, when you have a
chance to be a free man&mdash;even if not a happy
man&mdash;to stay here, and let your enemy, who
sent you to this place, laugh and think how his
plot against you has succeeded?"</p>

<p>The dreamy look of weary resignation on
Maxime Dalahaide's face changed to alertness.
"Why do you speak of an enemy, and a plot
against me?" he asked. "That poor girl was
murdered; but I have never thought that she
was killed because her murderer wished to
involve me. That part was an accident. Liane
Devereux&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is not dead," broke in Virginia. "She is
on our yacht now, in the harbour of Noumea.
When you come, and she sees you, she will
confess the whole plot."</p>

<p>"But I saw her lying dead&mdash;a thousand
times that sight has been before my eyes."</p>

<p>"It was not she. If you want to know all, to
fathom the whole mystery, and learn how to
prove your own innocence, you will not refuse
to do what we ask."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Maxime's thin face no longer looked like a
carving in old ivory. The statue had come to
life. The spring of hope had begun to stir
in his veins. "If it were possible to prove it&mdash;at
this late day!" he exclaimed. "But even if
it were&mdash;you forget the tremendous difficulties
in the way of escape. How could I reach your
yacht? It could not come near enough to
shore here to pick me up; even a small boat
would be seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at night," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Remember, it is moonlight. The night will
be like day. Long before a small boat could
reach the yacht from the beach she would be
followed, overtaken, and not only should I be
brought back, but I should have the misery of
knowing that I had been the cause of bringing
my brave friends into trouble. They would
fire upon us. If I were killed it would matter
little enough; but if you were to be shot&mdash;&mdash;"
He spoke to George Trent, but his eyes moved
quickly to Virginia's face.</p>

<p>"My sister would be waiting for us on board
the <i>Bella Cuba</i>," said Trent. "Roger Broom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and I will take jolly good care of ourselves&mdash;and
of you, too, if you'll only give us a chance."</p>

<p>"If you'd come here a month ago," sighed the
prisoner, "before I got this wound in my back!
Now I'm afraid it's too late. I've let myself
go. I thought I saw the one door of escape for
me opening&mdash;death; and instead of turning my
back I walked toward it. I've let my strength
down. I haven't eaten or slept much, and I
began to have a pleasant feeling of slipping
easily out with the tide. Now there's an incentive
to stop, the tide's too strong and I'm too
weak. I can't count on myself."</p>

<p>"Count on us," said George. "We'll see
you through, you bet. And think of your
sister. We promised we'd take you back with
us. We can't go to her without you, after raising
her hopes. It would kill her." Trent glanced
at Virginia, as if expecting her to add encouraging
arguments to his; but she was silent, her
eyes alone appealing to Dalahaide. George
Trent was her half-brother, and had known her
all her life, but he felt the thrill of that look in
the girl's beautiful eyes. How much more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
then, must Maxime Dalahaide have felt it, he
said to himself.</p>

<p>"It is the risk for you I think of&mdash;if I fail,"
the prisoner exclaimed. "If I had only myself
to consider I should hesitate no longer."</p>

<p>"We have come a long, long way to you,"
Virginia's eyes said; and her lips would have
added something had not George's hand fallen
suddenly in warning on her shoulder. "Somebody
is coming," he whispered. "For all our
sakes, don't fail us, Dalahaide. We shall look
for you to-night&mdash;there," and he nodded
toward the water. "Make your way to the
beach and hide among the rocks till you see our
little boat. Don't take to the water&mdash;remember
the sharks. If you're not there to-night, we'll
hang about till the next."</p>

<p>"We'll wait till you come, if we wait a year,"
said Virginia.</p>

<p>There was time for no more. The Commandant,
with Roger Broom by his side,
appeared round the corner of the winding path
near by.</p>

<p>"Well, mademoiselle, have we given you time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to finish your interview, and has it been satisfactory?"
asked the old Frenchman good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You have given us just enough time, and
it has been most satisfactory, thank you," the
girl answered. "I hope," she added, "to make
the very best use of it later." And again her
eyes met those of the statue that she had waked
to life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A CRY ACROSS THE WATER</h3>


<p>It was night in the harbour of Noumea;
a night of pitiless, white, revealing moonlight
which sharpened the black outline of every
shadow, and made the whitewashed wall of each
low house gleam like mother-o'-pearl. Had
there been no secret business on foot, Virginia
Beverly's beauty-loving soul would have been
on its knees in worship of the scene as she sat
on the deck of the yacht, which seemed not to
float in water, but to hang suspended in the
transparent, mingling azure of sea and sky.
To her the moon was an enemy, cruel and
terrible. She would have given her right hand
for a dark curtain cloud to be drawn across
that blazing lamp and the scintillating stars
reflected in the water like sequins shining through
blue gauze.</p>

<p>Midnight was near, and the yellow lights of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the town were fewer than they had been. The
quay was quiet and deserted, and the Ile Nou
was a black shape in the translucent glitter of
the water. On the <i>Bella Cuba</i> all was very still,
and each whisper of the little waves that lapped
against the side of the yacht came distinctly
to Virginia's ears.</p>

<p>The Countess de Mattos had not appeared
at dinner, but had sent excuses, her head being
much worse. But it was Virginia's opinion that,
once out of sight of Noumea, the lady intended
to be convalescent. Kate Gardiner also was
in retirement, and had for once shown temper
even to Virginia; but Dr. Grayle's report of
the day was reassuring, and as Kate had had no
opportunity of doing harm, even if she had
wished it, she and her grievances were dismissed
from Virginia's mind in these supreme
moments.</p>

<p>Her eyes were straining after a small electric
launch, which was already distant. Virginia
could not look away, and still she tried to persuade
herself that she could not see the little
black gliding thing distinctly, because, if it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
plainly visible to her, it must be so to other eyes
also&mdash;if eyes on shore were waking and watching
now.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boat disappeared behind a
buttress of rock silhouetted on the silver track
of the moon, and at the same instant the yacht's
anchor began slowly to be hauled up.</p>

<p>Virginia knew what that meant. To-night's
work was for Roger and George, not for her;
but she had each detail of the programme at
her fingers' ends&mdash;indeed, had helped to
arrange it. When the launch had gone a
certain distance from the <i>Bella Cuba</i>, on its
stealthy way toward the Ile Nou, the yacht's
captain&mdash;an Englishman, discreet and expert&mdash;had
orders to follow slowly. The start had
not been made earlier, because it was desirable
that town and prison should be asleep, and
the danger of discovery minimized. If the
yacht were seen moving in the night suspicion
would be aroused, for leaving the harbour of
Noumea is a perilous undertaking except
between sunrise and sunset; yet she must move,
and follow the boat like one of the great black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sharks swimming with grim expectancy behind
her, lest the little bark should be overtaken in
case of alarm and pursuit.</p>

<p>No explanation had been given to Captain
Gorst, who neither needed nor desired any.
His orders were to follow the boat, and stand
in as near the Ile Nou as possible without
arousing attention on shore; there to wait until
the launch returned, or to approach still closer
to the island, if pursuit rendered it advisable.
These orders Virginia knew he would obey to
the letter; and she knew also, though no word
had been spoken to her on the subject, that the
little cannon, which had been silent since the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> had been a lightly armoured despatch-boat
in the American-Spanish War, were ready to
speak to-night, if worst came to worst.</p>

<p>It was that vague "worst" that troubled
Virginia's soul as, almost soundlessly, the heart
of the <i>Bella Cuba</i> began to beat, and she glided
through the glimmering water. If only one
could know exactly where and how to expect
the blow, the thought that it might fall would
be more bearable, the girl felt. But one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
many things might happen to wreck their hopes;
and failure now probably meant failure forever.</p>

<p>Maxime Dalahaide might be too ill to make
the attempt to-night, or he might be watched
in the act of making it. The men in the launch
might miss seeing him, even if he had contrived
to escape from the hospital and gain the beach.
Or his flight might be discovered, and the launch
only arrive near the shore in time for its occupants
to see him dragged back to the old life,
with all its past horrors, and many new ones
added by way of punishment. Possibly the
coral reefs and jagged rocks might prevent the
launch getting close to shore, and Maxime would
have to swim out to it. Then, there were the
sharks. Virginia had already seen two or three
to-day&mdash;hideous, black shapes swimming far
down below the surface of the clear water&mdash;and
she shuddered as she remembered the great
snouts and cold, evil eyes of the man-eaters.
What was that the Commandant had said in the
afternoon? "The sharks are the best guardians
the Ile Nou can have." Were those horrible
watch-dogs of the sea on the lookout now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same moment, the same thought was
in the minds of Roger Broom and George Trent,
as the little electric launch rounded the point
of rock and lost sight of the <i>Bella Cuba</i>. The
water, as they looked toward the Ile Nou, which
must be their destination, was a flood of molten
silver poured from the white-hot furnace of the
full moon. They knew how black the launch
must be on this sheet of radiance, how conspicuous
an object to watchful eyes on shore;
and though the glittering sheen destroyed the
transparent effects of the water here, they
guessed what gliding shapes were surely upon
their track, coldly awaiting disaster.</p>

<p>Sitting in the boat they could not see the
hospital; not a light was visible in any prison
building; and they had the feeling that in any
one of a dozen great masses of shadow armed
surveillants might be hiding, to spring out upon
Maxime Dalahaide as he crept toward his
friends and far-off safety. There was no sound
except the crisp rustle of the water as the launch
cut through it; but as they entered the lagoon,
where among tall reeds the image of the moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
lay unbroken like a fallen silver cup, a whispering
ran through the rushes, as if to pass the news
of their approach from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tall figure rose up on a slight
eminence and waved its arms, then disappeared
again so quickly that it might almost have been
a fantastic shadow; but quickly as it had come
and gone, Roger and George knew that their
hope had not been in vain. Convict 1280 had
completed the first stage of his journey. He had
seen them coming to the rescue, and he had
given them the secret of his hiding-place.</p>

<p>The two men were alone in the launch. Now,
without a word, Roger Broom headed it for the
point where the figure had appeared. There
was a strange confusion of emotions in his brain,
which still left it clear to act. Under his habitual
air of lazy indifference he hid strong feelings,
and at this moment they worked within him like
fermenting wine. In this adventure he was
playing for great stakes. Twice in the last
year had Virginia refused him; her love and
her beautiful self were all that Roger craved for
in the world, but he had meant never to ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
for them again, when this mad scheme of rescue
had been conceived. He had opposed it as
foolish and impossible; then Virginia had hinted
that, if he would join her in it, giving help and
advice, she would refuse him nothing. After
that day he had thrown himself into the adventure
heart and soul, saying little, but doing all
that man could do. Though his few words had
sometimes discouraged Virginia's ardent hopes,
he had doggedly meant to succeed if he had
to die in the supreme effort. He had put his
whole soul into the work, with no other thought
until to-day. Then&mdash;he had seen what George
Trent had seen; a certain look in Virginia's
eyes as they pleaded with Maxime Dalahaide
to free himself. Her lips had said: "Do this
for your sister's sake." But her eyes had said:
"Do it for mine." Never had such a light
shone in those beautiful eyes for Roger; never
would it so shine for him; and he knew it
well, with a dull, miserable sickening of the
heart, which was like a pinch from the hand
of Death.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole face of the world had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
changed for him. He was a man of honour,
and he would go on along the path which he
had traced out for himself; but the wish to
succeed in his task for the sake of success was
murdered by that sweet light in a girl's eyes.
Something coldly calculating said to Roger
Broom that it would be a good thing for him if
Maxime failed to come to the rendezvous, on
that night or any other night; or, if, in case he
came, he should be retaken. Should this
happen, Virginia's implied promise need not
hold good, but Roger thought he knew her
generous heart well enough to be certain that
she would in the end reward him for what he
had tried to do, even though&mdash;not through
his fault&mdash;the fight had been in vain. On the
other hand, if he and George succeeded in saving
Dalahaide, in bringing Dalahaide to Virginia&mdash;but
Roger would not quite finish that thought
in his mind. Resolutely he turned his back
upon it, yet it grinned an evil, skeleton grin
over his shoulder, and he could not make his
ears deaf to the whisper that though he could
and would hold Virginia to the keeping of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
bargain, her heart would always have a holy of
holies shut away from him.</p>

<p>Roger hated the cold Voice that explained
his heart to his head, and he did his best not to
listen. But all he could compass was not to let
himself be guided by its promptings. If he
had desired Dalahaide's escape as whole-heartedly
as before, he could have worked for it
no harder than he did; still, he experienced no
warmth of gladness at sight of the dark figure
silhouetted for an instant against a moonlit haze.
Trent was not close to him in the launch, and
yet somehow he felt the thrill of joyous relief
which shot through the younger man's body
at the signal, and envied it. But all was different
with George; he could afford to be single-minded.
Roger knew very well that George
was in love with Madeleine Dalahaide, and
that there was nothing he would not sacrifice
for the happiness of giving her back her brother.</p>

<p>As Roger Broom wrestled with his own black
thoughts, the launch, which had hitherto slipped
swiftly toward its goal, dividing the rushes and
reeds of the lagoon, refused to move on. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
lush, green barricade was too thick to be cut
through by its clean bow and the force of its
powerful little electric motor.</p>

<p>"It's no good," whispered George. "We
can't get on any farther. This is what I was
afraid of. He'll have to come out to us. Thank
goodness, if we can't get through, neither can
the sharks."</p>

<p>"Where is he? Can you see him?" Roger
asked. And the Voice was loud in his ears
again.</p>

<p>"No, I wish I could. I don't like to sing out.
This luck of ours so far is too good to last."</p>

<p>"Stand up and wave your hand. Perhaps
he'll see and reply," said Roger.</p>

<p>Somehow he wanted George to take the initiative
now. He was afraid of being unconsciously
guided by the Voice.</p>

<p>George stood up and waved a handkerchief.
No figure rose in response, but as if in answer,
they heard a distant splashing in the water, and
then, following so quickly that it blurred the
impression of the first stealthy sound, came
the sharp explosion of a shot. Instantly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
slumberous silence of the tropical night was
shattered by a savage confusion of noises.
Other shots were fired, a great bell began to
clang, another boomed a sullen echo, and from
far away spoke the deep, angry voice of a cannon.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! that's the cannon on board
that beastly steam tub of theirs!" cried George.
"Luckily for us it's a makeshift concern and no
gunboat; but it can catch us on our way back
to the yacht, and if it does, all's up."</p>

<p>Roger did not answer. His ears were strained
for the splashing in the water, if still it might be
heard as an undertone beneath the distant din
of the alarm. The launch could not advance
a foot farther, if it were to save all three lives;
and it would take some time at best for Dalahaide
to wade, and swim, and fight his way to
them, among the tangling reeds. The escaping
prisoner was weak still from his recent wound;
no matter how high his courage might be now,
it could not in a moment repair the physical
waste which he had voluntarily allowed to go
on, courting the sole release he had then foreseen.</p>

<p>The one chance left, now the alarm was given,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
lay in the hope that, though Dalahaide's flight
from the prison hospital had been discovered,
the direction he had chosen was not yet known.
But the lagoon was at least as likely a place for
the search to begin as any other; and then the
launch might have been seen moving across the
bright streak of the moon's track before it could
reach the shelter of the rocks on its way to the
lagoon. A few minutes at most, and the hounds
would be on the right scent.</p>

<p>These things Roger told himself, but he had
not sat still to listen. After the first second of
straining attention, he sprang up, threw off his
coat and waistcoat, and kicked off his shoes.</p>

<p>"I'm going to help him if I can," he said.
"His strength may fail, or some stray shark
may be a little cleverer than its fellows and find
its way through the rushes. Anyhow, here
goes; and if Dalahaide gets to you before me,
don't wait. Push out the best you can, and I'll
catch you up, swimming."</p>

<p>There was no time for arguing or objecting,
even if it had been in Trent's mind to do either.
Since it was right for one to go, and Roger chose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to be that one, he must stay; but, even for Maxime's
sake, and for Madeleine's, he could not,
he decided, leave Roger Broom to follow&mdash;for
there were the sharks. No, they three must
stand or fall together, whatever happened now.</p>

<p>The lagoon, in the spot where Roger left the
launch, was too deep for wading, nor could he
swim there. Somehow&mdash;he scarcely knew how&mdash;he
seemed to tread water, his feet slipping
among the slimy tangled stems that were like
a network under the surface, a brackish taste
in his mouth, the rank, salt smell of seaweeds in
his nostrils, and his ears a soft, sly rustling
which might mean the disturbed protest of
a thousand little subterranean existences, or&mdash;the
pursuit of an enemy more deadly than any
on land.</p>

<p>It was a harder task than he had thought;
still he persevered. "Dalahaide, where are you?"
he called.</p>

<p>"Here!" came the answer, only a few yards
away. "I'm caught in something, and up to
my knees in mud. I think my wound's broken
out again. For heaven's sake, go back and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
let them take me. After all, what does it matter
for me? I'm done. A thousand times better
die than get you all into trouble."</p>

<p>"You <i>all</i>!" Even in that moment Roger said
to himself that "all" meant Virginia. Dalahaide
was thinking of her. He would rather
die than she should be punished for this bold
attempt to break the law. But aloud Roger
cried out that he would go back with Maxime
or he would not go back at all, and cheering the
other, with death in his own heart, he struggled
along, half swimming, half wading, but always
moving on, how he hardly knew. Then at last
he saw a dark head, and a face, white in the moonlight,
floating seemingly on the reedy surface of
the lagoon, like a water lotus on its stem.</p>

<p>Roger grasped a handful of slippery stems and
held out a strong left hand to the wounded man.</p>

<p>"Take hold, and I'll pull you out," he said.</p>

<p>The two hands met, one thin and white with
a prison pallor, the other brown and muscular
and dependable. They joined, and Roger held
on to the bunch of slippery stems so hard that
they cut into his fingers. Once he thought they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
were yielding, but at that instant Dalahaide
was lifted out of the mud in which he had sunk.
Roger caught him under the arm and held him
up. Scrambling, rustling, pushing, sinking, rising,
spitting out salt, brackish water, they struggled
back toward the launch.</p>

<p>There it was, waiting, Trent crouching down,
scarcely breathing in his agony of impatience.
They saw him, and at the same time their heads
came into sight for him, among the tall, dark
spears of the rushes. In another moment
George in the launch and Roger in the water
were pulling and pushing Maxime, half fainting
now, up over the side of the swaying boat.</p>

<p>As he tumbled in, limply, Roger saw a dark
stain on the wet, gray convict jacket. It was
black in the moonlight, but Roger knew it would
be red by day. The wound in his back had
broken out again, as he had thought; even if
they saved him now, it might only be to die. It
was the cold Voice that said this; and Roger
shuddered, yet half his nature welcomed the
suggestion. "I've done what I could, let him
die," was the answer that came. Quickly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
little launch began to back out from the entanglement
of the rushes, and as soon as there was
room George turned her and sent her out like
an arrow from the lagoon to deeper, clearer
water. Beyond a certain point of rock the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> should lie by this time, and once on board
her all might yet be well, for she could easily
show her heels to anything that walked the sea
in these waters.</p>

<p>They headed straight for the place where
they hoped to find the yacht waiting, and with
an exclamation Trent pointed to the sky, across
which floated a black, gauzy scarf of smoke.</p>

<p>"Ripping old chap, Captain Gorst," chuckled
George. "That's his signal. Trust him to be
where he's wanted on time and a bit before."</p>

<p>But Roger was silent. There was a thought
in his mind with which he could not darken
George's mood by speaking out. Sufficient
for the moment was the evil thereof.</p>

<p>They were close to the jutting rock now, and
it seemed within ten minutes of safety. But
something shot into sight round the point, something
big, and black, and swift, with a gleam of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
fiery eyes and a belching stream of smoke
streaked with fire.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" stammered George. "It's not
the <i>Cuba</i>. It's the Government boat, coming
down on us. We're trapped, sure as fate."</p>

<p>The words rang in Maxime Dalahaide's ears
and reached his dimmed consciousness. The
danger was not for him alone, but for the others
who were risking everything to save him. It
was this thought which seemed to grip him, and
shake him into sudden animation. He sat up,
resting on one elbow, not even wincing at the
grinding pain that gnawed within the lips of
his re-opened wound.</p>

<p>"Not trapped yet," he said. "Keep to the
right; to the right&mdash;not too far out. She
daren't come where we are, for she'd be ripped
to pieces on the reef, and she knows that."</p>

<p>"Hark! They've spotted us. She's hailing!"
cried Roger Broom.</p>

<p>"<i>Halte! halte!</i>" came harshly across the
moonlit space of water, as, obedient to Dalahaide's
quick hint, the course of the launch was
changed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The three fugitives were mute, and again a
raucous cry broke the silence of the sea.</p>

<p>"Halt, or we fire!"</p>

<p>"They've two cannon," said Maxime. "I
was mad to bring this on you, my friends. If
they fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let them fire, and be hanged to them!"
grumbled George Trent. "Two can play at
that game. In heaven's name, where's the
yacht? Ah&mdash;you <i>would</i>, would you!"</p>

<p>This in answer to a shot that, with a red
blaze and a loud report, came dancing across the
water, churning up spray and missing the
launch by a man's length.</p>

<p>"Keep her going, George," said Roger as
quietly as was his wont. "Our hope's in speed
now, and dodging, till the <i>Bella Cuba</i> takes a
part in this game."</p>

<p>As if the calling on her name had conjured
her like a spirit from the "vasty deep," the
graceful form of the yacht came into sight.
George, tingling with the joyous lust of the
battle, could not resist a hurrah; but his shout
was deadened by the din of another shot, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
then an answering roar from the <i>Bella Cuba</i>.
One of those cannon of hers had "paid for its
keep" at last. Now the yacht, and every one on
board her&mdash;to say nothing of the three who
wished to be on board&mdash;were in for a penny,
in for a pound.</p>

<p>The act just committed was an offense against
law and justice (not always the same) and joined
hands with piracy. To be caught meant punishment
the most severe for all, possibly even international
complications. If the French prison-boat
sunk the yacht and the launch, and drowned
every soul concerned in this mad adventure,
she would be within her rights, and the fugitives
knew it well. The <i>Bella Cuba</i> had flung the
red rag into the face of the bull, and Roger
Broom and George Trent thought they saw Virginia's
hand in the unhesitating challenge.
Captain Gorst might have thought twice before
assuring himself that the time had come to obey
orders given in case of dire necessity; but once
would be enough for Virginia.</p>

<p>"She's given herself away!" laughed George,
keeping the launch between the lagoon and an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
irregular line of dark horns which, rising just
above the shining surface of the water, marked
a group of coral reefs. "There won't be much
doubt in Johnny Crapaud's mind now as to
what part that tidy little craft's cast to play in
this show, eh? Hello-o!"</p>

<p>Another blaze and a following roar drew the
exclamation; but before George had had time
to draw breath after it, he and Roger and Maxime
were all three in the water. The ball from
the little cannon of the prison-boat had done
its work better this time, striking the electric
launch on her nose and shattering her to pieces.</p>

<p>George Trent was a brave man, but his first
thought was "Sharks!" and the horror of it
caught his throat with a sensation of nausea.
The instinct of self-preservation is strong in all
healthy men, and, though an instant later he
was ashamed on realizing it, the fear that
thrilled him was for himself. He expected, as
his momentarily scattered senses told him what
had happened and where he was, to feel huge
teeth, sharp as scythes, meet round his thigh
and cut off a leg as cleanly as a surgeon's knife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>While he still quivered with this living horror,
he remembered that the danger was Roger's
and Maxime's as well as his, and manhood and
unselfishness came back. He forgot himself in
his fear for them, more especially for Maxime&mdash;poor
Maxime, who had suffered so much
that it would be hard indeed if he were to meet
a ghastly death in the very act of achieving
safety and freedom. Madeleine's beautiful,
tragic face rose, clear as a star, before his eyes,
and he knew that it would be reward enough for
him if he could give his life for the brother she
loved so well. If she should say afterward,
"Poor fellow, he died that you might live,
Maxime," he felt that the words and the gratitude
in the girl's heart would warm him even,
if his grave were to be under these dark waters
at the other end of the world.</p>

<p>He had gone down at first, and a hundred
thoughts seemed to have spun themselves in his
head by the time he rose to the surface. Shaking
the water out of his eyes, he looked anxiously
round for Roger and Maxime. They were
nowhere to be seen, and a pang shot through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
George Trent's breast like a dagger of ice.
What if one or both of them had already met
the terrible fate which he had pictured for
himself?</p>

<p>His whole soul was so concentrated upon this
fear that for a few seconds he was deaf and
blind to everything outside; but suddenly he
realized that the firing between the yacht and
the Government boat was still going on, a further
cannonade which woke strange echoes over the
water.</p>

<p>"Roger&mdash;Dalahaide!" he called. No answer
came, but, as his eyes strained through the
haze of moonlight, a dark dot appeared on
the bright mirror of the sea, moving fast, and a
cry was raised which, though not loud, carried
clearly, and seemed to George Trent the most
terrible he had ever heard:</p>

<p>"A shark&mdash;a shark!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>"ONCE ON BOARD THE LUGGER"</h3>


<p>It was Roger Broom's voice which sent
across the water that ominous shout so
appalling to Trent's ears. Mechanically
George swam toward the place where the
dark head had risen, but as he took his first
stroke a second head appeared beside the
other, then both went down together.</p>

<p>That moment concentrated more of anguish
for George Trent than all the years of his past
life had held. He believed that both Roger
and Maxime had almost before his eyes suffered
the most hideous death possible to imagine,
and he knew that at any instant he might share
their fate. But that thought no longer shook
him as before. Since the others had died
so horribly it would be well that he should
die too. A moment of sharp agony, and all
would be over. Better so, since he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
not go back to Virginia or to Madeleine Dalahaide
alone.</p>

<p>His eyes strained despairingly over the cruel
glitter of the rippling sea, with a cold, vague
feeling that he had reached the edge of the world,
and was looking over into the dim mystery of
the next. He was young and vigorous, and had
loved life for its own sake; but, with Roger and
Dalahaide both dead, there was no longer a full-blooded
craving for help to save himself in his
mind as he gazed toward the yacht and the
French boat. Instead he wondered with a sickly
curiosity how long it would be before the filthy
brutes, which had put an end to his companions,
would make a meal of him, and whether it would
hurt much, or if unconsciousness would come
soon. Mechanically he swam on, more or less in
the direction of the <i>Bella Cuba</i> and the French
boat, which were at close quarters now; and
perhaps there was a scarcely defined hope in his
heart that a stray shot might finish him before the
hideous "guardians of the Ile Nou" found their
chance.</p>

<p>The state of his own brain and nerves became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a matter of cold surprise to him; the suspense
without fear, though tingling with physical
dread, and the capacity for separation of
emotions. He found himself thinking of Virginia,
and pitying her. This would break her
heart, he told himself. She would have a morbid
feeling that she was to blame for the disaster;
that she had caused the death of her brother
and cousin, and the other man so strangely
important in her life of late. He wished that
he might talk to her, and tell her not to mind,
because it was not in the least her fault, and
she had done nothing but good.</p>

<p>Then he began to wonder why the yacht and
the French boat had ceased firing. The latter
had only two guns, while the <i>Bella Cuba</i> had
four, and, as he had said to Roger a few minutes
(or was it years?) ago, she was but a poor "makeshift,"
rigged up more as a kind of "scarecrow"
for <i>for&ccedil;ats</i> meditating escape than for actual
service. Still, she must carry at least ten or
twelve rounds of ammunition. Could it be that
the little <i>Bella Cuba</i> had contrived to knock a
hole in her hull, and that her men must choose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
between beaching her immediately or having
her sink? It looked as if this explanation might
be the right one, for she was certainly retiring,
and that with haste. To beach she must go
round the point whence she had come in,
approaching the lagoon, and this she was doing,
the yacht having no more to say to her.</p>

<p>"The Frenchies know what their sea-wolves
have done," George thought grimly, "and so
they can afford to let things slide and save
themselves. No good sending out a boat and
trying to pick up their man under the nose of
the enemy, for the poor fellow's gone where
neither friends nor foes can get him. The
episode is closed. And all the <i>Bella Cuba</i>
wanted was to put the prison boat out of the
running. There's no good being vindictive.
I could get to her now, if I liked&mdash;provided
those brutes would let me. But it's impossible&mdash;I
won't think of it. Afterward I should
loathe myself for being a coward and going
back to life without the others. I couldn't have
helped them&mdash;but it would seem as if I might
have, and didn't. Heavens! When is this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
going to end? I can't bear it long. The best
thing I could do would be to drown myself like
a man, and get it over before the worst can
happen."</p>

<p>He flung up his arms, meaning to sink, and
wondering whether it would be really possible
for a strong swimmer deliberately to drown himself,
or whether instinct would keep on countermanding
the brain's orders, until exhaustion did
its work. One last look at the world he gave
before the plunge, and that look showed him a
thing which he could not believe. Between him
and the black horns of the outer reef he saw
once more two dark heads close together.</p>

<p>"It can't be!" Trent said to himself; nevertheless,
instead of flinging away life, with all
his strength he struck out lustily toward those
floating dots in the water. Then, suddenly,
something cold and solid rubbed against his leg.
How the knowledge of what it was and what to
do came to him so quickly, and how he acted
upon that knowledge swiftly almost as light
moves, he could not have told; but he knew
that a shark was after him; he knew that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
must turn over on its back in the water before
the cavernous, fang-set jaws could crunch his
bone and flesh, and like a flash he dived.
Queerly, as he shot down through the water,
he thought again of something outside the
desperate need of self-preservation. "This is
what happened when I saw their heads go down
before and supposed it was all up with them
both!" he said to himself. "That's what they
are supposing about me now, if they're looking
my way. Well, we shall see. It's going to be a
race between this infernal brute and me. I'd bet
on him&mdash;but the dark horse sometimes gets in."</p>

<p>After that he had no more consecutive
thoughts. Primitive instinct guided him, and
hope was the light which marked the goal.
The others were not dead yet, so he had a right
to his life, if he could keep it; and toward that
end he strained, swimming as he had never
swum before, diving, darting this way and that,
feeling rather than seeing which spot to avoid,
which to strive for. At last his foot touched rock.
He had reached that part of the jagged coral-reef
which rose out of the sea. He ceased to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
swim, and found that slipping, sliding, stumbling
on a surface, which felt to clinging hands
and feet as if coated with ice, and smeared with
soap, he could scramble up to a point above
water. He got to his knees, then to his feet, and
as he stood up, dripping and dizzy, a shout
came to him. Roger's voice again!&mdash;but no
longer sharp with horror and loathing. There
he stood on another low peak of the reef, and
Dalahaide was beside him, slimmer, taller, and
straighter than he, as the two figures were darkly
outlined against the light.</p>

<p>They were safe, at least from the sharks; and
from the <i>Bella Cuba</i> a boat with four rowers was
swiftly approaching. The reaction of joy after
the resignation of despair was almost too great.
George Trent's throat contracted with a sob,
and there was a stinging of his eyelids which
was not caused by the salt of the sea.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he cried out, waving his hand to
the two men on the reef, and to the rowers in the
boat. While his shout still rang in the air a
<i>canot</i>, such as that in which they had crossed
from Noumea to the Ile Nou, manned by twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
rowers, leaped round the point of rock behind
which the French boat had disappeared, and
came straight as an arrow for the reef on which
the three men stood.</p>

<p>Now it was a race once more for life and death.
The yacht's boat had the start, but those twenty-four
oars carried the <i>canot</i>, heavy as it was, far
faster through the water. The <i>Bella Cuba</i> could
not use her cannon lest she should destroy her
own friends, so nearly did the two boats cross
each other as both from, different directions,
sped toward the same goal.</p>

<p>The yachtsmen's blood was up, and they
worked like heroes, but they were four to twelve.
The <i>canot</i> shot ahead and got the inside track.
The race, as a race, could now have but one end.
The <i>canot</i> was bound to be first at the spot where
the runaway <i>for&ccedil;at</i> and one of his English friends
stood side by side out of reach of the hungry
sharks, but not beyond the grasp of justice.
The fugitives, who had fought so long with the
sea, were unarmed, while the four surveillants
in the <i>canot</i> had revolvers, and would either
recapture or kill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>But Maxime Dalahaide spoke a word to his
companion; and, as if the triumph of the <i>canot</i>
over the yacht's boat had been a signal, the two
sprang from the shelf of the reef into the sea.
George Trent knew well what was in their minds;
they preferred to risk being food for sharks to
certain capture; and without hesitating for an
instant, George followed their example. If they
could swim under water to the yacht's boat before
the sharks took up the prison cause, all was not
yet lost, for the boat would do its best to dodge
the <i>canot</i> while the <i>Bella Cuba's</i> cannon seized
their chance to work once more.</p>

<p>George kept under water as long as he could,
then came up to breathe and venture a glance
round. Crack! went a pistol-shot close to his
head, and he dived again; but not before he had
seen the yacht's boat not thirty yards off. How
near the <i>canot</i> lay he had not been able to inform
himself, but the narrow shave he had just had
gave him a hint that it could not be far distant.
He aimed for the boat as well as he could judge,
felt an ominous, cold touch, dived deeper for a
shark, forged ahead again, trying to forget the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
double danger, came up to breathe because he
must, and could have yelled for joy, if he had had
breath enough in his lungs, to see that either
Roger or Maxime was being pulled into the
yacht's boat, while a second head bobbed on the
water a couple of yards away. The air cracked
with revolver-shots, but George was not the
target now: the eyes of the surveillants were for
the fugitives nearest safety. Whether Roger or
Dalahaide were hit, George could not tell, but
he kept his head above water in sheer self-forgetfulness
until both had been hauled on
board. Then he dived again, and when he
rose to the surface he was close to the boat.
It was his turn to be helped over the side and
to become a target. Something whizzed past
his ear, leaving it hot and wet, and he had a
sudden burning pain in his left arm; but nothing
mattered, for there were Roger and Maxime,
and he was beside them. The rowers had set
to their work with a will once more, not to reach
the <i>Bella Cuba</i> with the best speed, but to dodge
from between her guns and the <i>canot</i>. Once she
could let her cannon speak, the <i>canot</i> was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
longer to be feared. Brave as the Frenchmen
were, clearly as they had right on their side,
from their point of view, they would have to
recognize that they were helpless, that the rest
of the battle was to the strong.</p>

<p>A moment more, and one of the little cannon
roared a warning. She did not try to hit the
<i>canot</i>; the message she sent was but to say,
"Hands off, or take the consequences." And the
men of the <i>canot</i> understood. Not only did they
cease firing, but began to retire with leisurely
dignity toward the point which hid the disabled
prison boat.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, when all such peril was over,
the thought of that slimy, cold touch on his flesh,
and what it had meant, turned George Trent sick.
He did not see how he or his friends had escaped
the horror. If it were to come again he was sure
that escape would be impossible; and somehow
he knew, as if by prevision, that there would be
nights so long as he lived when he would dream
of that touch in the water, and wrench himself
awake, with sweat on his forehead and his hands
damp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roger, are you all right, and Dalahaide,
too?" he asked, wondering at the weight he felt
on his chest and the effort it was to speak.</p>

<p>"Thanks to Dalahaide, I am all right,"
Roger answered. "If it hadn't been for his
quickness and presence of mind, twice I should
have been nabbed by a shark. Weak as he
was, he pulled me down for a dive that I should
have been too dazed to think of without him."</p>

<p>"I have cause enough to know something of
these waters and their danger," Maxime said
slowly, as if he too found it an effort to speak.
"I was weak, yes, but strength comes of great
need, I suppose; and already I owed you so
much. I had to think and act quickly; besides,
it was for myself too."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven it's all over," exclaimed
Roger, with a great sigh. "We've a good
doctor on board. He'll know how to make you
fit once we have you there. And that will be
shortly now. See, here's the yacht! In ten
minutes you'll be in the stateroom that has been
ready for you ever since we left Mentone a few
hundred years ago, bound for New Caledonia."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, your passage was engaged from the
first," chuckled George, with an odd little catch
in his voice that would have been hysterical if he
had been a woman. "And I'll bet something
you'll like your quarters. Two lovely ladies took
a lot of trouble with them&mdash;your sister and
mine."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say, or how to thank
you," stammered Maxime. "It goes so far
beyond words."</p>

<p>"Just try to <i>live</i> your thanks, if you think
they're worth while. I reckon that's what our
two sisters would say on the subject. Don't let
there be any more talk about dying like there was
to-day, that's all, you know. And oh, by Jove!
doesn't it feel queer to be gabbling this way,
when you remember what we've just come out
of&mdash;those grinning brutes down there, with
their red mouths in their white shirt fronts,
so to speak. Ugh! I don't want to think
of it, but I'm hanged if I can help it. I say,
did those Johnnies' revolvers do any damage
here?"</p>

<p>"Dalahaide got a bullet in his shoulder, as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the wound in his back wasn't enough to remember
the place by," said Roger. "He says it's
nothing, and I hope that's the truth" (he actually
did hope it now, at least for the moment);
"as for me, I believe they've saved the yacht's
barber a little trouble in cutting my hair on the
left side, that's all; luckily no harm done to any
of our men."</p>

<p>All these scraps of conversation had been flung
backward and forward inside five minutes.
Then they were at the yacht's side. Maxime,
forced to yield to his own weakness in the reaction
now, was being helped on board, the
others following.</p>

<p>A slim, white figure, ethereal and spirit-like in
the sheen of the moon, was waiting to give them
welcome. Virginia stood on deck, weeping and
laughing, Dr. Grayle by her side.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! Thank heaven!" she
sobbed at sight of Maxime. The cry was for
him, the look, the tears, the clasped hands, all
for him. Roger and George came together for
her in a second thought, and Roger knew; though
he was not surprised, because he had guessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
her secret, such joy of success as even he, being
a man, had felt, was blotted out for him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Down below, locked into their staterooms,
Lady Gardiner and the Countess de Mattos had
passed a strange and terrible hour, each in a
different way.</p>

<p>To Kate there was little mystery, though
much fear. She had sulkily shut herself up, and,
not dreaming what was appointed for the night,
had finally dropped asleep, while meditating
reprisals for the bad treatment she had received
that day. But though her suspicions had not
gone as far as an actual rescue in dramatic
fashion, with the first shot from the prison boat
which woke her from a sound sleep, she divined
what was happening. Bounding from her
berth, while hardly yet awake, she darted to her
porthole, which was wide open. It faced the
wrong way to afford her a glimpse of what was
going on, but she could hear more firing at a
distance, doubtless at the prison on the Ile Nou,
the ringing of bells, and much tramping overhead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
on the deck of the yacht. She felt the throb of
the engine too, and though the <i>Bella Cuba</i> had
been lying quietly at anchor in the harbour
when Kate had fallen asleep, now she was moving
at a rapid rate through the water, which
gurgled past her sides.</p>

<p>Kate had known, of course, that they had not
come thousands of miles for nothing, and the
moment she was certain that New Caledonia was
to be the <i>Bella Cuba's</i> destination she realized
that an attempt would be made to save Maxime
Dalahaide. She had been anxious to earn the
other half of the Marchese Loria's money, and
at the same time to pay Virginia and George
Trent for their secretiveness, by letting Loria
hear of their arrival, at least, even if she could
tell him no more. That desire had been
thwarted by Dr. Grayle, but Kate considered
the act merely postponed. Next time they
coaled&mdash;since they must coal somewhere before
long&mdash;she would certainly find a way of wiring
to Loria, and probably she would have something
much more definite to tell him, that was all.
Exactly what that "something" might be, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
been rather vague in her mind; but she
had thought that Virginia, George, and Roger
would most likely have found means to communicate
with Dalahaide and give him hope
for the future; perhaps they might even try to
put in his hands some means of escape, after
which the <i>Bella Cuba</i> would linger about in these
waters, out of sight of New Caledonia, until he
either succeeded in getting away or failed signally
to do so. This plan Kate had considered
not beyond the bounds of possibility; or (she had
told herself) Virginia, who was so enormously,
absurdly rich, might be counting upon bribing
some lesser prison authority to help the convict
to escape. So daring a girl, sure of the power of
beauty and wealth, and with millions of pounds
to play with, might have conceived such a scheme
and have the boldness to carry it out. She
could offer any bribe she liked, and&mdash;every
man was said to have his price. It was conceivable
now to Kate that Virginia and Madeleine
Dalahaide had had confidences together, and
that the mysterious locked stateroom had been
specially fitted up for the benefit of the prodigal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
It would be like Virginia to have made such a
wild plan, and to persuade Roger Broom
and George Trent to aid her in carrying it out;
yet Kate had not guessed to what desperate
lengths they would be ready to go. She had
forgotten about the yacht's cannon; but when
she heard the shot from the French boat she
suddenly remembered them, and wondered,
in great terror, whether they would be put
to use. She realized that the trio meant to
stop at nothing to gain their end and that
this end was to have Maxime Dalahaide
out of prison at any cost to themselves and
others.</p>

<p>Into the midst of her confused deductions
broke the yell of a shot from one of the yacht's
guns. It was as if the <i>Bella Cuba</i> were alive
and had given a tiger-spring out of the water.
Kate shrieked with fear, and staggered away
from the porthole. Her first thought was to
run out of the stateroom and seek refuge somewhere&mdash;anywhere.
But, with her hand on
the bolt with which she had fastened the door,
she realized that she was as safe where she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
was as she could be elsewhere, in the dreadful
circumstances&mdash;perhaps safer. But she was in
deadly terror. As a roar from the French boat
was answered by another roar from the yacht,
which again shivered and leaped like a wounded
thing, her knees gave way under her, and she
half fell, half crouched on the floor of the stateroom,
shuddering and moaning. The danger
seemed as appalling, as hopeless to escape from,
as an earthquake which, go where you would,
might tear asunder the ground under your feet
and bury you alive.</p>

<p>It was clear that the <i>Bella Cuba</i> and the
strange, ugly-looking steamboat she had seen in
the harbour, with its two unmasked cannon, were
waging fierce war upon one another. For all
that Lady Gardiner knew, Dalahaide was
already on board, and the prison boat was giving
chase; yet that could not be true, surely,
for suddenly the yacht's engines ceased to move;
it was as if her heart had stopped beating.
Had the <i>Bella Cuba</i> been struck? Was she
sinking? Even if not, one of those horrible
cannon-balls might come crashing into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
yacht's side at any moment, and every one on
board might be instantly killed.</p>

<p>Kate knew not what to do; whether to remain
where she was, or to crawl out into the cabin
and try to find some one&mdash;even the hateful
doctor&mdash;who would tell her how great the
danger was, and what one must do to be saved
from it. She forgot all about Loria, and Dalahaide,
and her many grievances, and only knew
that she wished to be spared from death, no
matter whose schemes failed or succeeded, or
who else lived or died.</p>

<p>The Countess de Mattos had not been asleep.
Her headache, perhaps, had kept her nerves at
high tension, and made rest impossible. As
she had confessed to Virginia early that morning,
on discovering the name of the next landing-place,
she did not like New Caledonia. The
thought of the place, and the secrets it must hold,
oppressed her. She wondered, with a kind of
disagreeable fascination which invariably forced
her weary mind back to the same subject,
whether the convicts' life was very terrible;
whether they lived long in this land of exile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
or whether they were notoriously short-lived.
The climate must be trying, and then there
were countless hardships to endure&mdash;hardships
which must be less bearable to those who had
known luxury and refinements. She did not
like to dwell upon anything that was painful
or even sordid; and when memory persisted in
dragging before her reluctant eyes the dead
body of any particularly hateful scene in her
past, as a cat will sometimes obstinately lay
before its master a rat it has mangled, she was
in the habit of dulling her sensibility by drinking
a little absinthe in which some chlorodyne had
been dropped.</p>

<p>When she travelled, she always carried two or
three bottles of the liquor with her, wrapped in
laces and cambric, in her luggage, for she had
grown used to it, and could hardly support life
without its soothing influence now. She was
careful not to take too much, however, for she
worshipped her own beauty; and absinthe was
an enemy to a woman's complexion.</p>

<p>She felt to-night, lying in the harbour of
Noumea, as she had felt sometimes during a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
furious <i>sirocco</i> in Sicily&mdash;restless, unnerved,
fearful of some vague evil, though common sense
assured her that nothing of the kind she dimly
pictured could possibly happen. She remembered
uncomfortable things more vividly and
painfully than usual, too; and, at last, she could
deny herself the wished-for solace no longer.
She rose from her berth, trailing exquisite silk
and lace (for the woman must always frame
her beauty worthily, even for her own eyes
alone), poured out half a glass of absinthe,
dropped in her allowance of the drug, added
water, till the mixture looked like liquid opal, and
sipped the beverage with a kind of dainty greed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she had ceased to care
whether the <i>Bella Cuba</i> lay in the harbour of
Noumea or off Sydney Heads. What did it
matter? What harm could come?</p>

<p>Presently, lying in her berth, dreamily staring
out at the moonlight through the open porthole,
her lovely arms pillowing her head, the Countess
became aware that the yacht was moving. So
they were getting out to sea again, she told herself.
A little while ago she would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
delighted, as if at an escape, because, as she
had said, Noumea was hateful, and no place for
pleasure-seekers. But now that the absinthe and
chlorodyne soothed her nerves she was comparatively
indifferent whether they stopped or
steamed away. Nothing unpleasant had happened.
Of course not; why should it? She
had racked her nerves, and given herself a headache
all in vain. Still, it was good to know
that she would see no more of that terrible land
of beauty and despair.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes comfortably, and was on the
way to the more welcome land of sleep when the
boom of the gun, which had wakened Lady
Gardiner, roused her from her lotus mood of soft
forgetfulness&mdash;the greatest joy which she could
ever know.</p>

<p>Her brain was dazed with the liquor and the
drug she had taken, and she was utterly unable
to comprehend the tumult and confusion which
followed.</p>

<p>Kate Gardiner had a clue to the mystery
which the Countess de Mattos did not possess.
The Portuguese beauty had no means of guessing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
what had brought the <i>Bella Cuba</i> to Noumea.
She had never heard any one on board speak
the name of Dalahaide, or that of any convict
imprisoned at New Caledonia, and the firing
between the yacht and the French boat suggested
nothing to her but horror.</p>

<p>She, too, was afraid, half-stunned with fear,
and she was angry with herself now for having
taken the absinthe and chlorodyne, because they
prevented her from thinking clearly&mdash;the very
thing which, a short time ago, she had wished
not to do. At first she lay still, burying her head
in the pillows; then she murmured prayers to
more than one saint, for she was an ardent
Catholic; and at last, unable to bear the suspense
and isolation any longer, she threw open
the stateroom door and ran out into the cabin.</p>

<p>No one was there; but above the sound of
trampling overhead she thought she could
distinguish voices, and Virginia Beverly's was
among them. If Virginia were on deck, the
Countess said in her mind, it would be well for
her to be there too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>VIRGINIA'S GREAT MOMENT</h3>


<p>She went up on deck, moving dazedly, with
a strange sense of unreality upon her, as if
she had somehow wandered into a cold, dim
world of dreams.</p>

<p>The firing had ceased, and the yacht was no
longer in motion. The confused whirlwind of
brain-shaking events which revolved in her
memory might now have been a part of the
dream in which she was still entangled. The
Countess de Mattos's beautiful eyes swept the
moon-drenched scene for enlightenment, but
none came.</p>

<p>They were not now in the harbour, that alone
was clear; but land was close, and black horns
of rock stood up out of the shining water as if
they had broken through a great sheet of looking-glass.
Across this bright, mirror-like surface a
small boat was being quickly rowed toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the yacht. It was very near now, and several dark
figures could be distinguished in it besides those
of the four rowers. Another boat, much larger,
with more than twice the number of oars, swiftly
rising and falling, was hurrying away in the direction
of a high, rocky point on the island itself.</p>

<p>A chill premonition of evil fell upon the
woman's soul. It was like a heavy nightmare
weight that might only be felt, not seen, and
could not be shaken off. But the Countess de
Mattos had experienced this undefinable misery
before, when the reaction came after taking too
large a dose of chlorodyne with her "solace."
She hoped that it was merely this now&mdash;that it
was no real warning of trouble or threatening
danger.</p>

<p>Virginia stood talking to Dr. Grayle and
gazing eagerly toward the advancing boat.
The Countess de Mattos glanced at the two wistfully,
longing to go to them and ask questions.
Yet something seemed to hold her back. It
was as if a whisper in her ear advised that there
were things it was better not to know. This
was ridiculous, of course. It was always more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
prudent to know about disagreeable things
before they could happen, and then sometimes
they could be prevented, or at least staved off
till one was more prepared to grapple with them.
But all the beautiful woman's prudence was in
abeyance to-night. The quality had not been
born in her, but acquired; which can never be
the same.</p>

<p>She felt weak and unnerved, with a great longing
to cling to some one stronger and wiser than
herself. But there was no such person at hand
for her. These others had their own interests.
If they really cared for her at all it was because
she was ornamental, a thing of beauty which it
is pleasant to have within sight; and usually it
was very convenient to the Countess de Mattos
to be considered thus. Indeed, most of the
luxuries which she loved so much more dearly
than the necessities of life came through her
distinct value as an ornament. But now what
was ordinarily enough for her failed to satisfy.
She felt horribly alone in the world, as if she
had slipped upon some terrible ledge of rock
overhanging a sheer precipice, and there was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
one&mdash;no one on earth to help her back to safety.
Tears of self-pity rose hot in her eyes as she
stood, not far from Virginia and the doctor,
hesitating what to do.</p>

<p>They were so absorbed in watching the
approach of the boat that they were unconscious
of her presence, and suddenly it began to fascinate
the Countess de Mattos also, as if it were
one of the discs which hypnotists give to their
patients. She, too, bent over the rail and gazed
at the boat as the rowers brought it nearer and
nearer, but she could not see the faces of its
occupants. For three or four minutes she stood
thus, and then the boat was under the yacht's
side and the men were coming up the ladder.</p>

<p>The Countess moved nearer to Virginia and
Dr. Grayle. She no longer intended&mdash;for the
moment at least&mdash;to catechize them, but it
occurred to her that, by merely standing within
earshot while the others exchanged questions
and answers, the mystery of this night's alarming
work would be explained to her. Without
being seen by her hostess or the little doctor,
she was so close now that the trailing silk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
lace of her <i>robe de chambre</i> was blown by the
light breeze against Virginia's white dress.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven&mdash;thank heaven!" she heard
the girl exclaim as some one came on board.
The pair in front of her crowded so closely
toward this person that she could not see who it
was, and could only suppose that it must be
Sir Roger Broom or George Trent returning
from some strange adventure. Then, suddenly,
she saw the newcomer's face, with the moon
shining full upon it, chiselling it into the perfection
of a marble masterpiece of old, thrown up
by the sea from some long engulfed palace.</p>

<p>She stared, incredulous, her breath in abeyance,
her heart stopped like a jarred clock.
Then, over Virginia's shoulder, a pair of dark
eyes found hers&mdash;eyes darkened with tragedy
while youth and joy should still have shone in
their untroubled depths.</p>

<p>Ah, the awfulness of that instant, the ghastly
horror of it! Something in the woman's brain
seemed to snap, and, with a loud shriek that cut
the new-fallen silence as a jagged knife-blade of
lightning cuts the sky, she threw out her hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to shut away the sight and fell backward, fainting.
Virginia turned, and knew that her great
moment had come.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the Countess de Mattos came to herself
she awoke gazing straight upward at the stars,
which danced a strange, whirling measure as the
horizon rose and dipped with the swift forging of
the yacht. She was lying on the deck, her head
supported on something low and soft, and Dr.
Grayle bent over her, kneeling on one knee.</p>

<p>"All right again?" he inquired cheerfully, in
his blunt way.</p>

<p>She did not answer, for with desperate haste
she was collecting her thoughts, linking together
broken impressions. An awful thing had happened.
What? she asked herself. Then suddenly
the vision flashed back to her, and she
shuddered. Lowering her lids, so that the thick,
black fringe of lashes veiled her eyes, she
glanced anxiously about. Had it been a vision
and no more, or was it real, and should she have
to meet those accusing eyes again? As she
debated thus Virginia stepped forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think, Countess, that you will do now,"
said Dr. Grayle. "There is a wounded man
below who needs my services, but refused them
until you should have recovered."</p>

<p>"Oh, go&mdash;go!" murmured his patient in
irritable weakness.</p>

<p>The little doctor got up, and as he walked
quickly away Virginia took his place.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Countess shook her head. Her face
looked lined and haggard, despite its beauty, in
the bleaching light of the moon, and Virginia
was almost sorry for her. She could afford to
pity the woman now, she thought, for she had
triumphed. Her case was proved beyond all
doubt, and even Roger, who had heard the
scream of recognition and witnessed the fainting
fit, could no longer deny that the Countess de
Mattos and Liane Devereux were one. Virginia
would not strike a blow at a fallen enemy,
and, holding this woman in the hollow of her
hand, as she believed she did, she was ready to
give such help as could be given without injuring
the cause she served.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go back to your stateroom?"
she went on. "You have had a great
shock, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Countess sat up quickly, pushing her disordered
hair away from her eyes. "I don't
know what you mean by a shock," she said,
"unless you refer to the terrible cannonading.
That was enough, I should think, to frighten
the bravest. No wonder I fainted. And then,
seeing that ghastly man, dressed like a <i>for&ccedil;at</i>,
all dripping wet, and stained red with blood,
was the last drop in the cup of fear. I cannot
think what horrors have been happening
to-night."</p>

<p>All Virginia's pity was swept away. Her heart
hardened toward this tiger-woman.</p>

<p>"Cannot you think?" she echoed bitterly.
"Then I will tell you. We have been rescuing
an innocent man, who for years has suffered
untold miseries for a crime never committed.
Thank heaven that his sufferings are ended at
last, for we have him on board this yacht, which
is carrying him away from New Caledonia at
about twenty knots an hour, and we have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
proof with us which will establish his innocence
before many days have passed."</p>

<p>"It is a crime for a <i>for&ccedil;at</i> to evade his prison&mdash;a
crime to aid him," cried the Countess.</p>

<p>"We are not afraid of the punishment," said
Virginia, hot, indignant blood springing to her
cheeks. "<i>We</i> are ready to face the consequences
of our own actions."</p>

<p>The emphasis was an accusation, but the
Countess de Mattos did not wince under the
lash. Even a coward may be brave in a hand-to-hand
fight for life; and it was only physically
that she was a coward.</p>

<p>"You are courageous," she said, almost
wholly mistress of herself now, "and, of course,
you know your own affairs best, dear girl. But
I am not so brave. This awful night has tried
me severely, and has come near to spoiling our so
pleasant trip. It has sickened me of the sea and
of yachting. I shall beg to be landed as soon as
convenient to you."</p>

<p>"It will be convenient to us when you have
confessed everything in writing," Virginia flung
at her, stung into mercilessness by the woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
brazen defiance. "Then, and not before, you
may leave this yacht."</p>

<p>The Countess de Mattos arose from her lowly
place as gracefully and with as much dignity as
such an act could be performed. While she
sat on the floor and Virginia towered over her,
the enemy had too much advantage of position.
The two were of one height, and, standing, they
faced each other like contending goddesses.</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles," said the elder woman.</p>

<p>"Riddles to which you have the key."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean, except that
it seems to me it is your intention to be insolent."</p>

<p>"In your code, perhaps, honesty is insolence.
But I do not wish to forget that, in a way, you
are my guest. I asked you to come for a purpose,
I admit; yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you admit that. Possibly you will condescend
to inform me what your purpose was?"</p>

<p>"My purpose was to make assurance doubly
sure. To-night I have done this."</p>

<p>"Evidently you do not wish me to understand
you."</p>

<p>"Say, rather, you do not wish to understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
me. I think you must do so, in spite of yourself;
but lest you should not, I will tell you. I suspected
that you were the woman whom Maxime
Dalahaide was accused of murdering. Now I
<i>know</i> that you are not the Countess de Mattos,
but Liane Devereux!"</p>

<p>The woman's green-gray eyes were like steel
in the moonlight. "Maxime Dalahaide; Liane
Devereux," she slowly repeated. "I never
heard these names."</p>

<p>Virginia was struck dumb by the other's
effrontery, almost frightened by it. If this
terrible creature withdrew into a brazen fortress
of lies, who could tell how long a siege she might
be able to withstand? The girl had been astonished
and dismayed in the morning, when the
first sally of the attack had failed; but then her
strongest forces, her most deadly weapons, had
been still in reserve. Now they had been brought
against the enemy's defenses and&mdash;the walls
had not fallen; there was no sign of capitulation.
A cold misgiving began to stir in Virginia's
mind. Would it mean failure if the Countess
de Mattos obstinately refused to tell the truth?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, she was only a girl, opposed to a
woman whose varied experience of thirty years
or more had endowed her with infinite resource.
Virginia's stricken silence gave the other a new
advantage.</p>

<p>"As you have said yourself," icily began the
Countess once more, "you are my hostess. You
flattered me; you made me think that you were
my friend; you asked me on board your yacht,
and I came, trustingly, ignorant that, under some
wild mistake which even now I do not comprehend,
you plotted my betrayal. Why, it was a
Judas act!"</p>

<p>"If I did evil, I did it that good might come,"
said poor Virginia. "And it <i>shall</i> come. You
are Liane Devereux. <i>You</i> were guilty of the
'Judas act.' Maxime Dalahaide loved you; and
with what motive I don't yet know, but mean to
know, you betrayed him to a fate worse than
death. For that you deserve anything. Yes, I
kidnapped you. That's what Roger called it,
and I don't repent now. You are here on this
yacht with Maxime Dalahaide, and we are on
the open sea. Unless you jump overboard, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
cannot get away from your atonement. Atonement&mdash;that
is the word. Oh, woman, woman&mdash;if
you <i>are</i> a woman and not a stone, think
what atonement would mean for you! You
must have had terrible moments, living with
remembrances like yours&mdash;a man who loved
you sent to a living grave. Now it is in your
power to make up to him&mdash;ever so little, perhaps,
but a thousand times better than nothing&mdash;for
the wrong you did. Do this&mdash;do it, and be
thankful all the rest of your life for the blessed
chance which heaven has sent you."</p>

<p>The Countess laughed. "You change your
tone suddenly&mdash;from threats to an appeal.
You would make quite a good preacher, but your
eloquence can have no effect on my conscience,
as I have not the remotest idea what you are
talking about. I had let myself grow fond of
you, and I was grateful for all these lazy, pleasant
weeks, and for the money you lent me; but now
that I know what was underneath your seeming
kindness I am no more grateful, and I shall do
my best to punish you for the wicked trick you
have played upon me. As for attempting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
prove that I am&mdash;what name did you give the
woman?&mdash;well, anybody except myself, you will
find it impossible. I have powerful friends who
would travel far to save me from any trouble.
You cannot keep me a prisoner on board this
yacht. You must touch again at land before
long, and then I shall go away and tell every
one what has happened on your <i>Bella Cuba</i>."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"We <i>shall</i> see," echoed the Countess. "And
now I am going to my stateroom. Perhaps I
may hope to be free from persecution there."</p>

<p>She swept away, looking gorgeously beautiful,
and as proud as a queen bent on holding her
crown against the people's will.</p>

<p>Virginia stood still, watching her; and when
the tall, stately figure had disappeared, a crushing
sense of defeat fell upon the girl.</p>

<p>Only a few moments ago, as time counted, she
had felt that, with Maxime Dalahaide's rescue,
she had every wish of her heart fulfilled. But
now she saw the position of affairs with changed
eyes. It was as different as a flower-decked ballroom
seen by the light of a thousand glittering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
candles, and again by sunrise when the candles
had burnt down and the flowers faded.</p>

<p>Maxime was out of prison; there was that, at
all events, to be thankful for, and there was
nothing at New Caledonia which could even
attempt to give chase to the wicked little <i>Bella
Cuba</i>. Nevertheless, the French Government
had a long arm, and would not quietly let a convict
sentenced for life be snatched away without
making a grab to get him back again. Virginia
had known this from the first, but when Roger
had pointed the fact out to her as one of the
difficulties to be encountered, she had said in
the beginning: "If we have the luck to rescue
him we shall have the luck to hide him," and
afterward, when she had seen the Countess
de Mattos at Cairo, she had amended the prophecy
by saying: "If they catch us we shall be
able to prove his innocence."</p>

<p>It had all seemed very simple, and she had been
impatient with Roger for bringing up so many
discouraging objections to her impulsively formed
plans. He had gone in with them at last, without,
however, pretending to be convinced, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
she had bribed him with a virtual promise of
marriage. He had done all that she had asked of
him, and more; and she would have to keep her
promise, but&mdash;had she accomplished enough that
was good for Maxime, to pay for the sacrifice?
It would be a sacrifice&mdash;a greater one than she
had known at first, greater than, somehow, she
had realized until to-day. She must pay the
price; and Maxime&mdash;what of him?</p>

<p>If his innocence could not be proved, through
the dead woman miraculously come alive, he
could never, at best, go back to France; and as
the crime of which he was accused came under
the extradition treaty, he would be safe nowhere.
He must&mdash;as he himself had said&mdash;lead "a
hunted life," wherever he might be. Neither
money, nor influence, nor yearning sister-love,
nor&mdash;the love of friends who would give their
heart's blood to save him, could shield Maxime
Dalahaide from the sword of Damocles, ever
suspended, ever ready to fall.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the Marchese Loria received Lady
Gardiner's telegram from Sydney, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
stunned. "Leaving here to-morrow," the message
ran; "destination unknown."</p>

<p>Unknown to her the destination might be, but
it was not unknown to him. He was almost as
sure that the <i>Bella Cuba</i> was bound for New
Caledonia, as if Dr. Grayle had allowed Kate
Gardiner to send her desired word from prison-land;
and although he had constantly assured
himself that if Virginia did go there it could do
no harm, now that he was morally certain she
would go, he quivered with vague apprehension.</p>

<p>At first, he could not force his mind to concentrate
itself upon the intricacies of the situation.
He walked up and down his room, like a caged
animal, trying to think how, if it were by moving
heaven and earth, he could prevent Virginia
Beverly and the convict Max Dalahaide from
coming together. Then, with the thought that
they might meet seething in his head, he would
stop abruptly and say to himself, as he had said
so often before: "Nonsense; you are a fool.
They cannot come together. There is everything
against it." Still, the root of fear was there,
and grew again as soon as burned away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>If he chose, he might send a warning to the
prison authorities at New Caledonia. He could
say that the <i>Bella Cuba</i> was a suspicious craft,
and ought not to be allowed in the harbour for a
single hour. But to do this, he would be
obliged either to proceed to Paris and give satisfactory
reasons why such proceedings should be
taken, or wire the warning message himself,
signing his own name. No other method would
be of any avail, as the governor of the prison
would pay no attention to an anonymous telegram,
and there was now no time to write a
letter. He would be obliged also to assert
positively that he knew the <i>Bella Cuba's</i> errand
to be treacherous; and, whether he went to
Paris, or telegraphed, through Sydney, to New
Caledonia, in either case Virginia was certain
to find out, later, what he had done. Such
secrets could not be successfully hidden, and
she would hate him for his interference. If there
was little hope for him now, there would be
none then.</p>

<p>When his wits began to work he regarded the
situation from all points of view. He admitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the remote&mdash;extremely remote&mdash;possibility that
the party on the <i>Bella Cuba</i> might actually contemplate
a rescue. He would almost have been
ready to stake his life that, if such an attempt
were made, it would fail ignominiously, with
disaster to all concerned&mdash;perhaps death to
more than one. But&mdash;it <i>might</i> succeed. If it
did, what would happen?</p>

<p>They would not dare to put back to Sydney
Heads. The yacht must be coaled and provisioned
somewhere. He consulted maps, and
saw that the most likely place for the <i>Bella Cuba</i>
to proceed on leaving New Caledonia was
Samoa. It seemed to him that she must go
there, in any case.</p>

<p>Loria did not wish to appear as an active
enemy of Maxime Dalahaide's. It was largely
owing to his efforts on the prisoner's behalf that
Max had been saved from the guillotine, and all
the Dalahaides must have known that. Virginia,
no doubt, knew it too. But what was to
be done, if he were not to fling aside the cloak of
his reputation as a friend of that unfortunate
family? The spirit of high romance ran in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Virginia Beverly's blood. She was capable of
marrying an escaped prisoner, and sharing his
miserable, hunted existence. Such a thing must
not be. Loria felt that it would be less bearable
to lose her through Max Dalahaide than through
any other man. He would rather see her Roger
Broom's wife than Maxime's, but he had not yet
given up all hope of having her for his own.</p>

<p>He would have just time to go to Samoa and
meet the <i>Bella Cuba</i> there, if he started at once.
The yacht would not leave Sydney Heads till
next day, according to the news in the telegram.
Then it would take her ten days more to reach
New Caledonia. There she was sure to remain
for some hours, at the very least. If he, Loria,
caught a certain "greyhound of the sea" which
was sailing from Cherbourg for New York the
following morning, took a fast express from
New York for San Francisco, and then sailed
immediately for Samoa, he could not fail to
be in time for the <i>Bella Cuba</i>. But the important
thing was to find an excuse to
account for his being there when the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not, luckily for his present plan, supposed
to know for what parts the yacht had been
bound; therefore, if he went to Samoa to visit his
friend the French Consul, who had once really
invited him to do so, even Virginia need not
suspect his motive. His opportune appearance
might pass merely as a rather odd coincidence.</p>

<p>If the <i>Bella Cuba</i> took away a fugitive on
board, the authorities at New Caledonia would
not remain idle. They would at once wire to
Sydney of a convict's escape, and the telegram
would be sent on to Samoa from there. A
description of the yacht would be given, and
inquiries would be made. But those inquiries!
It was because of them that Loria was ready to
make so strong an effort to be there in time.
Without him, the fugitive from justice might be
allowed to escape, despite the extradition treaty.
With him, Loria thought that he saw a way to
make the detention of the prisoner sure, and that
without showing the hand he played.</p>

<p>He had not lost many hours in indecision. As
soon as he had made up his mind what to do, he
wired to find out if there were still a berth to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
had on board the New York bound ship sailing
from Cherbourg next day. Even if he had been
forced to travel in the steerage he would have
gone, though he keenly disliked physical hardships;
but he was fortunate, and obtained a good
cabin for himself. As soon as this matter was
arranged he left for Cherbourg; and next day,
on board his ship, gazing across the tumbled
gray expanse of sea, he thought of Virginia on
her little yacht, and smiled. About this time,
perhaps, the <i>Bella Cuba</i> was steaming boldly
from Sydney Heads, bound for New Caledonia&mdash;on
what strange, desperate errand, who could
tell? The girl's heart was beating high with
hope, no doubt. How little she guessed that,
half across the world, a man was setting forth to
defeat her plans, even if they attained success!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>STAND AND DELIVER!</h3>


<p>The Marchese Loria had always been lucky
in games of chance. In this biggest
game of all Fortune still stood behind him and,
with a guiding finger, pointed out the cards
to play.</p>

<p>There were no delays in his programme. His
ship arrived in port precisely at the appointed
hour. He was able to go on immediately to
San Francisco. There he was just in time to
catch a boat for Samoa. He wired to his
friend, Monsieur de Letz, the French Consul,
that he was coming, and received an enthusiastic
welcome. The Consul was a bachelor,
approaching middle age, was intensely bored
with the monotony of life on an island of the
Pacific, and was ravished with the chance of
entertaining a personage so brilliant in the great
far-away world as the Marchese Loria. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
had a charming house, and a good cook; some
wine also, and cigars of the best. Loria arrived
at dinner-time, and afterward, smoking and
talking in the moonlight on a broad verandah,
the guest led up to the question he was half
dying to ask.</p>

<p>"Have you heard any exciting news lately?"
he airily inquired, in a tone that hovered between
pleasantry and mystery.</p>

<p>"Does one ever hear exciting news in this
place?" groaned the French Consul. "Nothing
has happened for years. Nothing is ever
likely to happen again now that we have become
so dull and peaceful here."</p>

<p>"No news of another visitor?"</p>

<p>"Another visitor?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman from New Caledonia."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Is it then so difficult to know, <i>mon ami</i>?"</p>

<p>"One hopes so. It is not good that these
things should leak out and reach the public ear.
The information is very private. The authorities
at home and abroad do all they can to keep
it dark, and yet it seems&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"My ear isn't exactly the 'public ear,' as
I'll presently explain. But it is a fact, then,
that a convict has escaped from the Ile Nou,
and you have got word that he is likely to turn
up here on board a steam yacht?"</p>

<p>"It is a fact. I see you have the whole story.
But how did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that later. First, just a question
or two, if you don't mind, for I happen to be
interested in the affair. How long ago did the
fellow get away&mdash;or rather, when may the yacht,
the <i>Bella Cuba</i>, be expected here, if at all?"</p>

<p>"She might come in to-morrow."</p>

<p>Loria gave a long sigh. He was lying back in
a big easy-chair and sending out ring after ring
of blue smoke, which he watched, as they disappeared,
with half-shut eyes. One would have
fancied him the embodiment of happy laziness,
unless one had chanced to notice the
tension of the fingers which grasped an arm
of the chair.</p>

<p>"What will happen when she does come in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, trouble for me, and nothing to show
for it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean?"&mdash;with a sudden
change of tone.</p>

<p>"All I could do, I have done; which is to
inform the Government authorities here that on
board the expected yacht is a runaway <i>for&ccedil;at</i>
belonging to France, and ask that he be arrested
on the yacht's arrival."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then a boat will go out to meet this <i>Bella
Cuba</i> as she comes into the harbour, and she
will be requested to give up the man. Her
people will say that there's no such person there,
and refuse to let any one on board."</p>

<p>"But surely you could detain the yacht and
search? The <i>Bella Cuba</i> comes from Sydney
and New Caledonia. If you had reason to
believe that there was a case of plague on board,
for instance, the yacht would be quarantined."</p>

<p>"Yes; but if she were detained, and the convict
found on board, he couldn't be identified
by any one here. There has been no time for a
photograph to arrive from New Caledonia. He
won't be dressed like a convict; his hair will have
grown. I have only the description telegraphed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
His friends will take care he doesn't answer to
that. Even if the Government fellows here had
any pluck and wanted to attempt an arrest they
wouldn't dare, with no one to identify the <i>for&ccedil;at</i>.
You see, the yacht will be flying the English or
American flag, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can identify him."</p>

<p>"You? There is a mystery then. I scented
it at your first words."</p>

<p>"Scarcely a mystery. You have been very
good to answer my questions. Answer one
more now, and I'll explain everything. Suppose
I can put you in the way of identifying this
man, without chance of error; suppose I can
put you up to a trick for detaining the yacht,
is there any hope, if I proved to you it would be
for your own advantage, as well as of everybody
else concerned, that you could have the man
arrested, and sent back where he deserves to be?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman hesitated. Then he said
slowly, and more gravely than he had yet spoken:
"Yes, I think I could."</p>

<p>"That is well, for he is a fiend in human
shape, not fit to be at large. Worse than all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
if he escapes, he is almost certain to ruin the
life of the woman I love, and end my hopes of
winning her."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> We must send him back to New
Caledonia, to spend the rest of his life in the
Black Cell!" enthusiastically exclaimed De Letz.
"But my curiosity is on the stretch. A moment
more unsatisfied, and it snaps."</p>

<p>"It shall be satisfied on the instant. I'll tell
you the story in as few words as may be. You
remember the crime committed by this fellow&mdash;for
of course you know that, before he was
Convict 1280, he was Maxime Dalahaide?"</p>

<p>"I know that. I know he is a murderer.
But it is eight years, you must recollect, since I
was in France, long before the thing happened.
I took no particular interest in the crime, as I
had never met the Dalahaides. He killed a
woman: so much I recall. You were acquainted
with him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"To my sorrow. I thought he was my friend.
He was a traitor. I cared for his sister. She
loved and would have married me; but because
I knew too much about him and his evil ways,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
he did not want me in the family. He told the
girl and her parents lies. They believed them
and sent me away. He borrowed huge sums
of money of me, and never paid&mdash;never
meant to pay. Always he was my secret enemy,
yet when the world knew he was a murderer I
strained every nerve to save his life, for his
sister's sake. I did save it. But for every
one concerned it was better that he should be
removed where he could no longer strike at
society, and I could scarcely regret his fate.
Four years passed; I loved again, this time a
beautiful American girl, the most perfect creature
I have ever seen, and a great heiress.
Madeleine Dalahaide had learned to detest me.
She prejudiced this girl against me, and, not
satisfied with that, excited her romantic nature
to sympathy for the murderer, as a victim of
injustice. The <i>Bella Cuba</i> is this girl's yacht&mdash;Miss
Beverly's. She bought it in the hope
of rescuing Maxime Dalahaide, and if he can
escape, there is little doubt that she will put her
hand in his, red though it is with a detestable
crime. She must be saved from so ghastly a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
fate. But if she learns that she owes the failure
of her plans to me, she will hate me to the death,
and I shall lose all hope of her; whereas, if my
agency in this affair could be hidden from her
knowledge, the chances are that, if I could keep
my head, I might win back her heart, after it is
healed from its first disappointment. Help
me to accomplish this, De Letz, for the sake of
old times, and there's nothing you can ask of
me that I will not do. Italian though I am,
you know that my French cousins have powerful
political influence. They shall use it to the
utmost for you, and get you what post you
please. I promise it&mdash;and I never break a
promise to a friend."</p>

<p>"You fire me with your own enthusiasm!"
cried De Letz. "We shall work the thing between
us. But if you, and you alone, can
identify this man, how will your part in the business
be kept dark?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you how. I have brought several
photographs of him, which I have always kept
within reach. These I will give to you, and you
can use them. If possible, I should, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
like to appear, not in the character of an enemy,
but that of a friend. You may think this a low
way of playing the game; but, you know, 'all
is fair in love and war.' I want Miss Beverly
to think I am here at this time by chance; that
I have tried to soften your heart toward Dalahaide,
and that I come with you, not as your
ally against her, but to offer her and her cause
what help I can. Of course, I shall fail in that
effort, and you will win; but the little comedy
will have brought me the girl's gratitude, which
is worth all the world at this ticklish stage of
the game. Will you aid me to play the part on
these lines?"</p>

<p>De Letz laughed. "So, I am to be the villain
of the piece? Well, I do not mind. We
will stage the play realistically, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you will never regret your r&ocirc;le in it,"
returned Loria.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Before the <i>Bella Cuba</i> left Mentone all probable
contingencies of the mission had been
foreseen, and as far as possible provided for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
by Roger Broom, George Trent, and Virginia
Beverly, in council. They had talked over
what must be done in case of failure or success,
and the only event which Virginia had not
felt able to discuss had been the death of one or
more of the three men concerned in the rescue.
They knew that, if the <i>Bella Cuba</i> should be
lucky enough to get away from New Caledonia
with Max Dalahaide on board, the news of the
convict's escape would certainly reach the next
port at which they must touch, before they
could arrive there. Virginia's hope had been,
after meeting the Countess de Mattos, that the
woman's confession would exculpate Maxime,
and that the peace of his future would be
secured by the great <i>coup</i> of "kidnapping" her.
But now this glimpse of brightness seemed likely
to prove a mirage. Virginia was as sure as ever
that Manuela de Mattos was Liane Devereux;
even Roger Broom's contrary opinion had been
somewhat shaken by the woman's horrified
shriek at sight of Max Dalahaide's white face
and tragic eyes in the moonlight. But the
Countess had hardened once more into marble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
self-control, and Maxime, after an hour or two
on board the yacht, had fallen into a state
of fever and delirium. For the time being he
could do nothing to assist in proving her identity;
indeed, even if he had kept his senses, he
might not have been able to swear that she was
Liane Devereux, so many were the differences
of personality. Months might have to pass
before the truth of the strange conjecture could
be proved&mdash;if it could ever be proved&mdash;while
the Countess de Mattos remained entrenched
in her strong position as a much injured and
innocent lady.</p>

<p>They could not count upon her, and were
forced to rely wholly upon the plan formed
before the beautiful Manuela had entered into
their calculations. On reaching Samoa it was
to be, as George Trent expressed it, a "game
of bluff." One hope of saving Max lay in the
fact that no photograph of him could have
arrived from New Caledonia; there were a hundred
chances to one that there would be no one
at Samoa who had ever seen him; he could not,
therefore, be positively identified, and as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<i>Bella Cuba</i>, owned by an American girl, flew
the stars and stripes, it was not likely that the
authorities would care to invite trouble by
attempting to detain a yacht sailing under
American colours. It was well known to the
initiated also, that successful "evasions" from
the French penal settlements were hushed up
with nervous caution whenever possible and
that the news of even an attempted escape was
seldom printed in French papers. This was
another advantage for the guilty <i>Bella Cuba</i>.
It might be considered better to let one convict
go free, than precipitate an international complication,
a world-wide sensation, especially as
there was no one with a personal interest to
serve in recovering this particular prisoner.</p>

<p>They steamed boldly on toward Samoa. The
morning that the island was sighted, Dr. Grayle
had pronounced Max Dalahaide better. The
delirium had passed. He was quiet, though
still very weak.</p>

<p>"I suppose he wouldn't be able to confront
that wicked woman and accuse her to her face?"
asked Virginia of the little brown man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Grayle shook his head. "Not yet," he
said. "Our motto must be forward, but not
too fast. He isn't fit yet for any strong excitement,
since we don't want to risk a relapse now
that he's getting on so well. I was rather
afraid the sight of all those souvenirs of the
past in his cabin would upset him when he
should be in a state of mind to recognize them,
but the effect has apparently been precisely
opposite. At first, before he entirely realized
things, and remembered where he was and
how he had got there, he seemed to think that
he was at home, and was continually talking
to his mother or sister, or calling for his father,
sometimes in English, sometimes in French.
Now he knows all, and when he heard how it was
your thought and his sister's to have so many
familiar objects surrounding him, to give an
atmosphere of home to the cabin prepared in
case of a rescue, the tears came to his eyes,
and he turned away his head on the pillow
to hide them from me. He believes that, even
in his unconsciousness, these things must have
made an impression upon his mind, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
their soothing influence drawn his thought
toward home, otherwise he must have raved
about the prison in his delirium, instead of
returning to old, happy days. So you see, Miss
Beverly, he has one more reason to thank you,
this poor fellow who has suffered so much, and
kept so brave and strong through all."</p>

<p>Virginia had been pale of late, but she
flushed at these words. "You believe him
innocent, Dr. Grayle!" she exclaimed. "You
wouldn't speak of him like that unless it were so."</p>

<p>"No one could have been with him as I have
these past few days, and not believe him innocent,"
said the little doctor in his quiet voice.
"Sir Roger thinks as I do, too, now. You
will be glad to hear that."</p>

<p>"I am glad," Virginia answered. But Roger
was not glad. Above all things he was just&mdash;sometimes
in spite of himself. He had helped
to nurse Max Dalahaide; he had changed his
opinion of him, and felt bound to say so; yet
he was not glad to change. He would have
preferred to go on believing Dalahaide a
guilty man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia had not the key to Roger's heart,
however, and she did not know that he had the
key to hers&mdash;to one hidden place there into
which she had hardly dared to look. She
would have kept it always locked, even from
herself, if she could; but because she knew that
there was something there to hide, she invited
Roger to go with her when Max sent word
through Dr. Grayle, begging to see his hostess.
She did not want Roger to be present when she
talked with Maxime Dalahaide for the first
time since his escape. She would have liked
to be alone with him, if that had been possible;
but for the very reason that the wish was so
strong in her heart, she denied it. Her cousin
Roger had risked his life to please her, and she
had a promise to keep. She meant to keep it;
and he had a right to be by her side when she
went to the man whom he had so nobly helped
to save.</p>

<p>But Roger refused. "No, dear," he said.
"Soon we shall be in the harbour at Samoa.
There is plenty to do. I want to be on hand
with George to do it. Let Dr. Grayle take you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to Maxime. He will know how long and how
much it is best for him to talk."</p>

<p>"We will be in harbour so soon?" exclaimed
Virginia. "The Countess! She will try to get
away, you know."</p>

<p>"She'll try in vain," responded Roger. "We
won't give her a boat."</p>

<p>"But there'll be ships and boats in the harbour.
She may call for help, and make us
trouble."</p>

<p>"I'll see to her," said Roger. "I don't think
we shall get much good out of detaining her;
but we've gone so far now, we may as well go
a little further."</p>

<p>They were talking in the saloon, out of which
the cabins opened, but they had spoken in low
voices, guarding against being overheard. Nor
could they have been overheard, unless by some
one making a special effort to listen. Such an
effort the Countess de Mattos was making.
She had kept to her cabin since the eventful
night of the escape from New Caledonia, and
had demanded her meals and other attentions
with the air of an insulted queen claiming her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
just rights. She always bent herself eagerly
to listen when she heard the murmur of voices
in the saloon, especially if they seemed to be
suppressed. She did not now catch every word,
but she heard "the harbour of Samoa"; "soon
in"; "the Countess&mdash;try to get away"; "call
for help&mdash;make us trouble"; "I'll see to her";
and she pressed her lips together in fierce anger,
her delicate nostrils quivering.</p>

<p>From her porthole she had not seen the land
in sight, and had had no means of knowing that
the time for her to act was so near at hand.
Since the night of her terrible shock, she had
revolved many plans in her mind, but the only
one upon which she had definitely decided
was to leave the <i>Bella Cuba</i> at all costs, and as
soon as possible. Her nerves were not in a state
to stand an indefinite strain, and she realized
that she could not bear much more. Even with
the chlorodyne and absinthe she hardly slept
now, and she scarcely cared to project her
thoughts beyond the time of escape from the
hateful yacht.</p>

<p>Now, she had one thing for which to thank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Virginia Beverly; the suggestion that she should
call for help when the <i>Bella Cuba</i> had steamed
into the harbour of Samoa. At once her excitable
brain seized the picturesqueness of a dramatic
situation. She saw herself, effectively dressed,
rushing to the rail and hailing any passing ship
which might be nearest. Sir Roger Broom,
or her late friend George Trent, might try to
stop her, but their violence would be seen from
some other ship, and her cause against them
would be strengthened.</p>

<p>Surely her appeals would not be ignored;
men, of whatever class or country, were never
blind to the distress of a woman as beautiful
as she. Yes, she would be rescued. The
story that she would tell must rouse indignation
against Virginia Beverly and her companions.
She herself had nothing to fear&mdash;nothing.
And the man on whose advice she had
spent years of exile would admire her more than
ever, when he knew what she had endured,
without breaking down. The end of her probation
had come. The reason for delay had
disappeared now, after all these years. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
would marry, he and she, and he would help
her to forget the past.</p>

<p>Manuela's reflections did not cause her to
waste time. They were a mere accompaniment
to her rapid action. Virginia had said
they would soon be in the harbour. She must
prepare herself to leave the yacht, and get ready
to carry with her such things as were indispensable.
Hurriedly she threw off the <i>robe de
chambre</i> of silk and lace which she had been
wearing, and put on a charming dress, suitable
for travelling. The long outstanding account for
this <i>confection</i> had been paid with Virginia
Beverly's money; but that was a detail.</p>

<p>When she was ready to go up on deck&mdash;which
she would do as soon as the yacht dropped
anchor&mdash;she took her jewels from the large
leather box where they were kept, and wrapping
everything in a soft silk scarf, she stuffed the
thick parcel into a handbag, which already held
several mysterious-looking bottles with the labels
carefully taken off. This bag was always locked,
except when the Countess was at her toilet;
then, for a brief time, the bottles came out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and a few tiny boxes and brushes; but she
never forgot to put them back into the bag
again, turn the key, and slip the latter on to the
gold key-ring which she wore on her chatelaine.</p>

<p>The bag packed with jewels, as well as its
legitimate contents, Manuela turned her attention
to the larger luggage. This she could not
carry away with her, if she were gallantly
rescued from her sea-prison by a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>;
but it would be as well to have the things which
she most valued ready to go later. She had
filled her cabin-box, and was in the act of locking it,
when the yacht's screw ceased to throb.
The <i>Bella Cuba</i> had stopped. Orders were
being shouted up above; and then came a
grinding sound as the anchor was slowly dropped.
The Countess de Mattos knew that they must
be in the harbour of Samoa. She flung open
the door of her cabin and stepped out into the
saloon. There sat George Trent, who, as she
appeared, looked up from a book which he was
reading, or seemed to read.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Countess," he said coolly,
rising and flinging away his book. "I'm glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
you're better, but I don't think, now I see
you in the light, that you look well enough
to be out."</p>

<p>"I was never ill," she answered haughtily&mdash;for
Virginia Beverly's brother could only be an
enemy.</p>

<p>"It's mighty brave of you to try and keep up
like this," said George, "but that was a bad
attack of yours the other night. I can see
you're not fit yet. You'd better go back and
lie down while we coal. The blacks will be
flying around, you know, and you'll get them
in your lungs."</p>

<p>"Let me pass," exclaimed the Countess,
making a rush to push by him and reach the
companionway.</p>

<p>"I'd do a good deal for you, Countess, but
I can't do that," retorted George. "It's against
the doctor's orders."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she panted. "Oh, you
shall suffer for this!"</p>

<p>"All I'm worried about now is that <i>you</i> don't
suffer. You really mustn't excite yourself. It's
not good, you know. It's as much as my place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
is worth to let you upstairs. I expect it would
be the best thing for your health to go and lie
down, but if you won't do that, why, I'll try
and entertain you here as well as I can."</p>

<p>The beautiful woman looked the tall young
man full in the eyes, hers dilated and burning
with the impotent fury in her soul. She was
wise enough to see that he was not to be beguiled.
If he, like other men, had his price,
nothing that she could offer would pay it. He
did not mean to let her go up on deck, and it
would be as useless as undignified to attempt
carrying out her will with a high hand. If there
were any hope, it was in stratagem. Without
breaking another lance against the impenetrable
armour of his obstinacy, she turned her
back upon him, swept into her cabin, and shut
the door. Having done so&mdash;her little bag still
grasped in her hand&mdash;she flew to the porthole
and peered out. If a boat had been passing,
or a ship at anchor visible near by, she
would have screamed for help; but nothing
promising was to be seen for the moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Virginia had spent the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
heavenly half-hour of her life. She had been
so divinely happy that she had forgotten the
danger ahead. To sit beside Max Dalahaide,
to meet his eyes, tragic no longer, but bright
with passionate gratitude; to know that he was
out of danger, that he would live, and owe his
life to her and hers; to hear the thanks, spoken
stammeringly, but straight from his heart, filled
her with an ecstasy such as she had never
known. It was akin to pain, and yet it was
worth dying for, just to have felt it once.</p>

<p>She was with him still when the yacht dropped
anchor.</p>

<p>"This is Samoa?" he said, half rising on his
elbow, and a quick flush springing to his thin
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes," Virginia answered. "But there is
no danger. My cousin says they will dare nothing.
We shall have coaled in a couple of hours,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a sound of voices came
through the open porthole, which was on the
side of the yacht opposite to Manuela's.</p>

<p>Some one in a boat was calling to some one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
on the deck of the <i>Bella Cuba</i>; and evidently
the boat was near.</p>

<p>Virginia's sentence broke off. She forgot
what she had been saying, and sprang to her
feet, her heart in her throat. It was the Marchese
Loria's voice that she had heard.</p>

<p>What could his presence here signify? Did
it mean unexpected disaster? Involuntarily her
frightened glance went to Maxime's face. Their
eyes met. She saw in his that he, too, had
recognized those once familiar tones.</p>

<p>"I will go on deck," she said brokenly, trying
to control her voice. "I&mdash;when I can I
will come back again. And&mdash;of course, Dr.
Grayle, you will stay here."</p>

<p>"You may trust me," said the little brown
man, with meaning in his words.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE GAME OF BLUFF</h3>


<p>Roger Broom had seen the boat coming
from afar. Already the lighters were
alongside, and the process of coaling was about
to begin. This would be got through as soon
as possible, and necessary provisions bought
from the boats plying from the town with
fresh milk, butter, eggs, meat, fowls, and
green vegetables. But Roger knew well that,
expedite their business as they might, the
<i>Bella Cuba</i> would not steam out of the
harbour without a challenge from the law.
The only shock of surprise he experienced
at sight of the official-looking little craft,
making straight for the yacht, was in recognizing
the Marchese Loria, the last man he
had expected to see.</p>

<p>As he stood on deck beside the quartermaster
near the rail, Loria hailed him by name, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the boat came alongside, and the four rowers
shipped their dripping oars.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir Roger, you are surprised to see me!"
the Marchese cried. "But, by our old friendship,
I hope you will let me come on board.
These gentlemen in the boat with me are the
United States Consul, Mr. Chandler; the French
Consul, Monsieur de Letz; and Herr Dr. Sauber,
the medical officer for the health of the port."</p>

<p>"Speaking for Miss Beverly as well as myself,
we shall be very pleased to see you," said Roger.
"Herr Dr. Sauber's business with us it is easy
to guess, and he is prompt in carrying it out.
Mr. Chandler and Monsieur de Letz are, no
doubt, your friends, Marchese, who have come
with you to pay us a friendly visit. We shall
be delighted to entertain them on board as well
as we can during the dreary process of coaling."</p>

<p>"I can't let you receive us on false pretenses,
sir," replied the United States Consul. "My
business and that of Monsieur de Letz is not
wholly friendly, unfortunately, although we
are both particularly anxious it should be carried
out in a friendly spirit. It is in this hope that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
certain formalities have been waived. It is, as
you know, your duty to receive Dr. Sauber on
board, and as you fly the American colours it is
your duty to receive me as the representative
of the authority of the United States."</p>

<p>"Charmed, I'm sure, to see you in any
capacity," said Roger, his tone unchanged.
"Though what the authority of the United States
should have to do in procuring us the pleasure,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The authority of the United States supports
France, as it is bound to do, in accordance with
the extradition treaty, in demanding that you
give up the fugitive convict, 1280, who came on
board your yacht at New Caledonia."</p>

<p>"We have no convict with us," retorted Roger.</p>

<p>"In that case you cannot object to search
being made," said Monsieur de Letz.</p>

<p>"We do most certainly object to being insulted,"
Roger replied. "Mr. Chandler, the
owner of this yacht is an American lady, Miss
Beverly. I call upon you as her Consul to
protect her interests, not to sacrifice them."</p>

<p>"Sir Roger," Loria broke in, before Chandler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
could answer, "I beg once more that you will
let me come on board with the doctor as a friend.
I will explain why, when we can talk together.
Though I am with these gentlemen, their errand
is not mine."</p>

<p>"The doctor I feel bound to receive," said
Roger. "But Miss Beverly, it seems to me, has
as much right to choose who her guests shall be
on board her own yacht as in her own house. If
she were here to speak for herself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is here to speak for herself," said Virginia,
at his shoulder. "Marchese Loria, I
invite you to come on board. I invite also the
United States Consul, whose protection I claim.
But I do not choose to have other guests."</p>

<p>"The health officer has a right to board us,
you know, Virginia," said Roger in a loud tone;
then close to her ear: "Hang it all! we are more
or less at their mercy. We can't get away
without coaling, and they know it. Our poor
little cannon are of no use to us here. We
can't afford to defy any of the powers interested;
they've got too many gunboats in the harbour.
Bluff is our game, and we've got to play it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
all it's worth. But you're perfectly right about
the Consul. Only, if you don't want Loria,
you needn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do want him," Virginia hastily whispered&mdash;"for
a special reason. And I want to talk
to him alone. But for heaven's sake keep the
Frenchman off! Who knows what <i>coup</i> he
may be planning?"</p>

<p>As if in answer, though he could not possibly
have heard, De Letz announced from the boat
that he did not wish to insist upon boarding the
yacht. He would trust his business in Mr.
Chandler's hands, since the lady preferred it.
This easy-going courtesy alarmed Virginia.
She felt instinctively that the enemy had a
strong trump with which to confound her
unexpectedly. Still, if she did not quite see
the enemy's game, at least they could not see
hers.</p>

<p>The gangway was let down. Loria, Chandler,
and the medical officer of the port came on board.
Then the gangway was drawn up, though the
French Consul and the four oarsmen sat placidly
in the boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The purser, who was busy receiving stores,
was sent for, to be interviewed by the doctor.
Roger, standing by, gave half his attention to
the conversation between these two, and half
to the United States Consul, who plunged at
once into the subject of the escaped convict.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Letz had informed him, he
announced, that if the fugitive were not given
up to justice by the American yacht, it would
be regarded by France as a direct and deliberate
affront. Meanwhile, the medical officer bombarded
the unfortunate purser with questions.
What ports had been visited? Where had the
passengers been taken on? None since Alexandria?
Humph! Alexandria was considered
an infected port at present. Any one ill on
board? No? Where, then, were the remaining
members of the party? In their cabins?
The doctor must ask, as a mere matter of form,
to see them.</p>

<p>Roger Broom's lips were suddenly compressed.
So this was the game. He saw it all now. The
doctor was in the plot. He meant to detain the
yacht in quarantine. If he succeeded in doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
this, Maxime Dalahaide was lost. Everything
else they had thought of, but not this.</p>

<p>"May I speak with you alone, Miss Beverly?"
Loria had begun to plead, the instant he had
set foot on deck. "Believe me, it is partly for
your own sake, partly for the sake of others
whose welfare is dear to you, that I ask it."</p>

<p>It was the thing for which Virginia had been
wishing. "Come down with me into the
saloon," she said.</p>

<p>"Could we not speak here, at a little distance
from the others?" urged Loria, who knew that
the doctor intended to visit the cabins.</p>

<p>"It is better below," the girl answered. She
was determined to be already in the saloon
before the others came down. "Come quickly,
and we can talk without being disturbed."</p>

<p>There was nothing for Loria to do but to
obey.</p>

<p>They went down the companionway; and
George Trent, on guard with his book near the
Countess de Mattos's cabin door, jumped up at
sight of Loria.</p>

<p>"What, you here, Marchese?" he began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
But Virginia cut him short with a look and
gesture both imploring and imperative.</p>

<p>"Leave us, George, I beg," she said. "Later,
there will be time for explanations."</p>

<p>Without a word, the young man bowed and
walked away. But he did not go farther than
his cabin. He wished to be at hand if he were
needed, as he might be, by and by.</p>

<p>On the other side of the stateroom door stood
the Countess, half crouching, like a splendid
tigress ready to spring.</p>

<p>"Marchese," George Trent had said. Who
was this Marchese? Could it be possible that
it was the one man of all others for whom her
heart had cried out? Had his soul, in some
mysterious, supernatural way, heard her soul
calling to him across the world? Had he
heard, and come to her here, to save her from
her enemies? In another moment she must
hear the voice of the newcomer whom George
had addressed as "Marchese," and then she
would know.</p>

<p>Even as she told herself this, schooling her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>impatience, the voice spoke. "Miss Beverly&mdash;Virginia,"
it said brokenly, imploringly, "for
the love of heaven don't misjudge me. I came
with those men to-day, not to help them, but
to help you&mdash;if I can. You must know I
would give my life to serve you. My life, do I
say? I would give my soul. It was in ignorance
of what would happen that I visited Samoa.
The French Consul is an old school friend. He
told me everything&mdash;I mean, the news from
New Caledonia. He has photographs of Maxime.
I tried to get them away, without his
knowledge, but I didn't succeed. You must
not be embroiled further in this terrible affair.
The best thing is for you to give the poor fellow
up, and I swear to you that, for your sake, and
for his&mdash;even though I believe him guilty&mdash;I
will find some means of saving him. The
doctor has been promised all sorts of favours
if he will state that there is a suspicious case
of illness on board; a stateroom door locked
against him will be enough to raise suspicions
that you are hiding a case of plague. You can
do nothing. Unless you give Maxime up, and
it is seen that you have a clean bill of health,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
you will be detained indefinitely in quarantine.
Further advices will arrive from New Caledonia,
representations will be made to the authorities
here, it will become an international question,
and you will be forced to surrender the escaped
prisoner. Maxime will then be lost, for I
should be unable to help him, if things had
gone so far&mdash;the hue and cry would be too
furious. De Letz is determined to thwart
you, but he doesn't know that I am a secret
ally of your plans. Trust to me. Give Maxime
up while there is time, and you will never
repent it."</p>

<p>"You make brave promises, Marchese," returned
Virginia. "But you do not name your
price. I suppose, like other men, you have
a price for what you say you can do?"</p>

<p>"I make no conditions," answered Loria.
"It hurts me that you could think of it. All
I want is a little gratitude from you&mdash;ah, no, I
cannot say that is all I <i>want</i>. Only, it is all
I ask. What I want more than anything on
earth, more than anything which even Heaven
could give, is the treasure of your love. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
that, I could fight my way, and Maxime Dalahaide's
way, through the place of lost spirits,
and laugh at the tortures of Hades. I dare not
ask for that treasure now. Give me what you
can, that is all, and my life's blood is yours, for
I worship you, Virginia. I dream of you night
and day. If I cannot have you for my wife,
I shall go to my grave unmarried, and the
sooner the better. There's nothing but you
in the world; no other woman but you; there
never has been for me, and never will be."</p>

<p>"It's false!" cried the voice of a woman,
husky with passion; and throwing open the
door of her cabin, the Countess de Mattos stood
on the threshold, not six feet distant from the
two in the saloon.</p>

<p>Carried away on the tide of his very real love
for Virginia Beverly, whose pale, spiritualized
beauty had gone to his head like wine, the hot-blooded
Italian was at a disadvantage. Strength
had gone out of him in his appeal. Physically
and mentally he was spent.</p>

<p>The passionate voice, the flaming eyes of the
woman suddenly seen in the doorway, struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
him like a double blow aimed at a drowning
man. "Liane!" he cried, before he could
regain the self-mastery which meant all the
difference between life and death.</p>

<p>"Yes," she flung at him in French, "I <i>am</i>
Liane&mdash;Liane Devereux. Come, every one,
and hear what I have to say. This man is a
traitor&mdash;traitorous friend and treacherous
lover!" She stopped for an instant, and threw
a glance round the saloon. Loria and Virginia
Beverly were no longer alone there. George
Trent, Sir Roger Broom, Kate Gardiner, and
two men who were strangers had suddenly
appeared as if by a conjuring trick. The
woman stood with her head held high, like some
magnificent wild creature of the forest at bay,
fearing nothing save loss of vengeance. She
was glad that all these people had come. The
more there were to hear the tale she meant to
tell, the more sure the stroke of her revenge.
Yes, she was glad, glad! And though she died
for it, under the knife of the guillotine, she
would ruin the man who had deceived her.</p>

<p>"He pretended to love me," she went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
"But now I know that he never did, for when
he vowed love and devotion his voice did not
once sound as I have heard it now, speaking
to that white-faced girl when he did not dream
I was near.</p>

<p>"I am Liane Devereux, not a Portuguese
woman, not the Countess de Mattos, therefore
Maxime Dalahaide is not a murderer, since I
live. It was the Marchese Loria who arranged
everything&mdash;even my name, and credentials,
and proofs of my identity as Manuela de Mattos,
in case they were ever needed. Oh, there was
nothing neglected. But now I know that it
was not for my sake, as I thought, but to serve
his own ends, and I am willing to die to hold
him back from success.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the whole story from the
beginning. Five years ago I was an actress in
Paris. I made two or three failures. A powerful
dramatic critic had vowed to drive me off
the stage. He had begun his work; and at
this perilous time in my career, just as I had
quarrelled with my manager, Maxime Dalahaide
fell in love with me. I thought he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
rich. It occurred to me that if I became his
wife I could leave the stage in a blaze of glory.
Besides, he was brilliant and handsome. I
was flattered by his admiration, and felt that it
would be easy to love him. I did all I could to
win an offer of marriage from him. When it
came I accepted. But soon after our engagement
his father lost a great deal of money. I
realized that Maxime would not be as good a
match as I had counted upon making. Still,
I did not throw him over; for by that time I
cared for his handsome face, and I was of far
too jealous a nature to risk throwing him into
the arms of another woman. If we parted, I
thought I knew to what woman he would turn.
There was an English girl singing at the Opera
Comique, whose name at one time had been
coupled with Maxime Dalahaide's. She had
a good voice and a pretty enough face, but she
would not have succeeded in Paris, people
whispered, if Maxime had not helped her. I
had spoken to him of this girl, and he had denied
caring for her. She was a very ordinary,
uninteresting creature, apart from her beauty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
he said; but she had been friendless and in
hard luck, and as he was half English himself,
he had done what he could to aid a lonely and
deserving young countrywoman, that was all.
Still, I was never sure that he was not deceiving
me. Altogether, in those days, I was unhappy.
The Marchese Loria, Maxime's best friend&mdash;as
I thought&mdash;was very sympathetic. He came
often to see me, both with Maxime and alone.
One day they quarrelled in my house. It was
Loria who began it. He accused Maxime
of prejudicing his sister Madeleine against him,
and Maxime admitted that, though he loved
Loria, he did not think he would made a good
husband, and did not wish him to marry Madeleine.
With a look of jealous hatred in his
eyes, which I have never forgotten, Loria cried
out that Maxime had always taken away from
him everything he wanted most&mdash;love of
friends and women, popularity, all that a man
values in life. Then, almost before Maxime
could answer to vow that never, consciously,
had he been Loria's rival or injured him in any
way, Loria begged forgiveness, said he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
spoken in anger&mdash;that in his heart he did not
mean a word. So the quarrel&mdash;if quarrel
you could call it&mdash;was made up. But I
guessed then that Loria had never really loved
Maxime.</p>

<p>"It was only a few days after this that I found
myself in great trouble with my creditors. Maxime
had had too many losses to help me much,
though he lent me two or three thousand francs.
I asked him to pawn my jewels, which were
worth a good deal, and to do it in his own name.
It was Loria who put this idea into my head.
He said that by this means I should prevent the
pawn-tickets from being seized by other
creditors. Late that very afternoon, when,
against his will, Maxime had taken my jewels,
the English girl, Olive Sinclair, came to my flat,
saying that she must talk to me of an affair of
great importance to us both. I was curious,
and my jealousy was up in arms. She was
admitted by my maid, who was just going out
for the whole evening, by my permission.</p>

<p>"Olive Sinclair came in. We were alone
together in the flat. She began by saying that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
she was going to England by the late boat that
night, and that Maxime Dalahaide was going
with her. As soon as possible, the girl went
on, they would be married at a registrar's office,
and the marriage kept secret from his family
until she came of age the next year, when she
would inherit a fortune, which she should be
only too glad to share with her beloved Maxime.
She had heard, she said, that I went about boasting
everywhere of my engagement to Maxime
Dalahaide, and that she could bear it no longer,
so she had come to tell me the real truth, and
humble my pride. Perhaps I would not have
believed her if I had not known that Maxime
<i>did</i> intend to go to England that night. He had
told me that he wanted to see an uncle there
on business. At once his story seemed improbable.
I believed that the girl was telling me the
truth. I have always had a hot temper, which
often escapes beyond control. A wave of rage
rushed up to my head, and made a red flame
leap before my eyes. As the girl talked on,
smiling insolently, I struck her in my passion.
She staggered, and fell on the floor, her head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
pressed up against the fender in a curious way.
Dear heaven, I can see her now, lying there,
her eyes staring wide open, seeming to look at
me, her lips apart! She did not cry out or
move; and as I stood watching her, frightened
at what I had done, a few drops of blood began to
ooze from her mouth.</p>

<p>"I went down on my knees, and shook her
by the shoulder, calling her name; but her
head fell on one side, as if she had been a horrid
dummy made of rags; and still her eyes were
staring and her blood-stained lips smiling that
foolish, awful smile. It was at this moment
that I heard a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>"At first I kept quite still, dazed, not knowing
what I should do. But then I thought it
might be Maxime, who had changed his mind
about selling the jewels, and come back soon
to tell me. I was in the mood to see him at
whatever cost. I called through the door to
know who was there. Loria's voice answered.
I let him in, explained confusedly what had
happened, and begged him to bring the girl
back to consciousness. Five minutes later he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
told me that she was dead. In falling, and
striking against the fender, she had broken
her neck.</p>

<p>"'What is to become of me?' I asked. 'I
did not mean to kill her, and yet&mdash;I am a
murderess. Will they send me to the guillotine
for this?'</p>

<p>"'No, because I will save you,' Loria answered.
Then, quickly, he made me understand
the scheme that had come into his mind.
So cunning, so wonderfully thought out it was,
that I asked myself if he had somehow planned
all that had happened; if he had sent the girl to
me, and told her to say what she had said,
counting on my hot blood for some such sequel
as really followed. But I could not see any
motive for such plotting, and in a moment I
forgot my strange suspicions, in gratitude for
his offer to save me. Sometimes I had fancied
that, in spite of his wish to marry Madeleine
Dalahaide, he loved me; now he swore to me
the truth of this, and I was scarcely surprised.
He would give everything he had in the world
to save me, he said. What a fool I was to believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
him! All I had to do in return was to promise
that I would obey implicitly. Gladly I promised,
and I did not falter even when the full
horror of his plan was revealed. It was that
or a disgraceful, terrible death for me. Oh, I
would have done anything then to escape the
guillotine!</p>

<p>"First of all he made me write a letter to
Maxime, telling him that I hated him and never
wished to see him again; that I loved another
man better. I did this gladly. That was
nothing. And Loria let me go out and send
the letter, while he began the awful work which
had to come next. I thanked him for that. I
had not nerve enough left to help much after
what I had gone through.</p>

<p>"When I came back to the flat after sending
off the letter, Loria unlocked the door for me.
Already the worst was over.</p>

<p>"His idea was for me to escape and let it
seem that <i>I</i> had been murdered. This could
be done, because Olive Sinclair would not be
missed. She had given up her rooms to leave
for England that night. In a bag hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
from her belt were her tickets for train and boat.
We were of much the same figure. Loria, in
speaking to me of her before, had mentioned
this slight resemblance. Her hair was brown,
while mine was red-gold. Hers would have
to be bleached, now that she lay dead. But
there was no great difficulty in that, for I
had the stuff in the house, as I used it in
very small quantities to give extra brightness
to mine.</p>

<p>"While I had been gone Loria had fired shot
after shot into the poor dead face, from a
revolver, which he did not show me. Afterward,
when I was far away, I heard that the
weapon was Maxime's; but, honestly, I did not
think at the time that Maxime would be implicated
in this affair. I was half mad. I
thought only of myself, and of Loria's self-sacrifice.
Already I could have worshipped
him for what he was doing to save me.</p>

<p>"He shot the hands, too, that they might
be shattered, for Olive Sinclair's hands were
not like mine; but before he did that, he
had slipped two or three of my rings, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
he had found on my dressing-table, upon the
dead fingers.</p>

<p>"All this was finished when I dragged myself
home. But together we bleached the dark hair
till it was the colour of mine, and together we
dressed the body in my clothes, Loria having
removed the gown before he used the revolver.
Oh, the horror of that scene! It is part of my
punishment that I live it over often at night.
At last we arranged the shattered hands to look
as if the girl had flung them up to protect her
face from the murderer.</p>

<p>"I put on her travelling dress, and her hat,
with a thick veil of my own. Meanwhile, a
knock had come at the door. I feared that the
shots had been heard, and that we would be
arrested. But Loria quieted me. He said the
revolver was small, and had made scarcely any
sound; that, as no one lived in the flat above
or just underneath, it was quite safe. We did
not answer the knock, though it came again and
again. But afterward, in the letter-box on the
door, there was a packet containing the money
which Maxime had got from the pawnbroker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
for my jewels. That I took with me, and Loria
gave me more. Whether Maxime himself
brought the money, or sent it by messenger,
I did not know; but, afterward, the <i>concierge</i>
bore witness that he had passed into the house
before the murder must have taken place, and
gone out long afterward. And dimly I remembered,
in thinking of Loria as he had looked
in that dreadful hour, that he had worn a coat
and hat like Maxime's. How can I tell what
were the details of his scheme? But when
Maxime was accused of the murder, and Loria
made no effort to exonerate him, it took all my
faith in the Marchese as a lover to believe that
he was sacrificing his friend wholly for my sake.
As for me&mdash;why should I give myself up to
the guillotine for a man who would have betrayed
me for an Olive Sinclair&mdash;especially when
he was not condemned to death, but only to
imprisonment?</p>

<p>"I went to England in Olive Sinclair's place.
Fortunately for me, she had no relatives. No
one asked questions, no one cared what had
become of her. She was not a celebrity, in spite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of the way in which Maxime Dalahaide had
worked to help her. After a while I left England
for Portugal. Meanwhile I had dyed my hair,
and stained my complexion with a wonderful
clear olive stain which does not hurt the skin,
and shows the colour through. Here are the
things I use, in this bag. I keep it always
locked and ready to my hand.</p>

<p>"Loria bought me a little land and an old
ruined house near Lisbon, belonging to an
ancient family, of whom the last member had
died. The title went with the land. It was
supposed that I was a distant cousin, with
money, and a sentiment of love for the old
place. But really I hated it. It was dull&mdash;deadly
dull. I travelled as much as possible,
and Loria had promised that at the end of the
five years he would marry me, saying always
that he loved me well; that if he had sinned
it was for love of me, and to save me. When
the world had forgotten the affair of Maxime
Dalahaide we would be married, and live in
countries where no one had heard the story,
and nothing would remind us of the past. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
forced myself to believe him, for he was my all&mdash;all
that was left to me in exile. But now
I know him for what he is. I would swear
that he planned everything from the beginning
to ruin Maxime Dalahaide. He here to
help his old enemy! No, it is he who must have
set the bloodhounds on his track. I fight under
Loria's banner no longer. He loves Virginia
Beverly. Now that she knows him as
he is, and what he has done for hatred, let
her put her hand in his if she will."</p>

<p>The woman's voice fell from a shrill height
into silence. Her olive-stained face was ash-gray
with exhaustion. No one had interrupted,
or tried to check the fierce flood of the confession,
not even Loria. All had stood listening,
breathless; and Virginia had known that,
behind the door of his locked cabin, Maxime
Dalahaide must hear every clear-cadenced word
of fine, Parisian French.</p>

<p>Loria had stood listening with the rest, a
sneer on his lips, though his eyes burned with
a deep fire. If he had taken a step, hands
would have been thrust out to stop him. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
he did not move except, in the midst of
Liane Devereux's story, to play nervously
with an old-fashioned ring of twisted, jewel-headed
serpents on the third finger of his
left hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the woman finished, he raised
the hand to his lips and seemed to bite the
finger with the ring. Then he dropped his
hand and looked at his accomplice with a
strained smile. But the smile froze; the lips
quivered into a slight grimace. His eyes,
glittering with agony, turned to Virginia.</p>

<p>"I loved you," he said, and fell forward on
his face.</p>

<p>"He has taken poison!" exclaimed Chandler,
the United States Consul. "It must have
been in that queer ring."</p>

<p>He and Roger Broom and George Trent
and the German doctor pressed round the
prostrate figure, but the woman who had
denounced him was before them all. With a cry
she rushed to the fallen man, and, flinging herself
down, caught up the hand with the ring.
They saw what she meant to do, and would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
have snatched her away, but already her lips
had touched the spot where his had been, and
found the same death.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The whole situation was changed by the unexpected
developments on board the <i>Bella Cuba</i>.
Dr. Sauber had relinquished, indeed, almost
forgotten, the clever plan by which the yacht
was to be detained. The French Consul,
Loria's host, was hurriedly brought on board,
to be dumbfounded by a recital of what had
happened. With Loria dead, and guilty, the
fugitive concealed on the <i>Bella Cuba</i> innocent,
De Letz's personal motive for detaining the
prisoner disappeared. His chivalry was fired
by Virginia's beauty and the brave part she had
played. In the end, instead of making difficulties
for the party, he consented to take charge
of his friend's body and that of Liane Devereux,
which latter duty was his by right, as consul
to the country from which she came. The
dead man and dead woman would be carried
ashore in the boat which had brought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
four men out to the yacht; and De Letz would,
acting on the statement of those who had heard
the confession, make such representations to
France as would eventually obtain for Maxime
Dalahaide a free pardon with permission to
return to his own land. Meanwhile he (De
Letz) reiterated that it was as much his duty
as before to bring about the arrest of the
escaped convict, who had no more right to
break his prison bonds if innocent than if
he were guilty. To bring it about if possible!
But&mdash;<i>was</i> it possible? And the Frenchman
shrugged his shoulders, half smiling at Virginia.
Mr. Chandler advised him that, in the
present circumstances, it would be unwise to
make the attempt. De Letz was inclined
to agree, and, as Dr. Sauber had apparently
found a clean bill of health, the <i>Bella Cuba</i>
must take her own sweet way, rebel though
she was.</p>

<p>So when the yacht had finished coaling she
steamed out of the harbour of Samoa with
Convict 1280 still on board.</p>

<p>Virginia's desire was to make for America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
and to send for Madeleine, who had been living
all this time with her aunt in an old Surrey
manor-house belonging to Roger Broom. The
brother and sister should stay at her house in
Virginia until Maxime was free to return to
France, and he would grow strong and well,
and everybody concerned would be happy. It
would be madness, she urged, for Maxime to
put himself in the power of French law until
such time as his innocence was officially
acknowledged.</p>

<p>But Maxime thought otherwise. His innocence
had been declared, and would sooner
or later be acknowledged. The manly and
honourable thing to do was to trust to the
generosity of his adopted land. To France
he would go, and boldly throw himself upon
her mercy.</p>

<p>"He is right, Virginia," said Roger, fearing
the while that secret jealousy influenced his
decision.</p>

<p>"He is right," echoed George Trent, with no
hidden thoughts at all.</p>

<p>Virginia held her peace, though her heart was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
full; and the ultimate destination of the <i>Bella
Cuba</i> was France.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>France did not disappoint Maxime's trust,
but months passed before he was a free man.
Meantime hope had given him new life. His
sister was near him. Virginia Beverly was in
Paris with an elderly relative of Roger Broom's
as her chaperon-companion, instead of Kate
Gardiner. Though he was virtually a prisoner,
since the eye of the law was upon him,
and the voice of the law pronounced that he
should go so far and no farther, still he was
happy, so happy that he often awoke from
prison dreams, not daring to believe the present
reality.</p>

<p>Then at last the day came when he was free.
Madeleine was staying with Virginia. He
would see them together. There was heaven
in the thought. George Trent was there, but
not Roger Broom. Roger had been called to
England on business, but he was returning
that evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Never had there been such a dinner as that
which celebrated Maxime's release from the old
bonds. Virginia had taken a beautiful house
which had been to let furnished, near the Bois
de Boulogne.</p>

<p>After the dinner the two girls with their brothers
went out into the garden, the old aunt, exhausted
with over-much joy, remaining indoors.</p>

<p>Virginia knew what would come next, and
drew Madeleine away from the two young men
that George might have the chance of asking
Maxime for his sister. Five minutes later
Maxime was squeezing Madeleine's hand, and
telling her that no news could have made him
so happy. Then, somehow, the lovers
disappeared, and Virginia Beverly and Maxime
Dalahaide were alone together.</p>

<p>"Everything good comes to us from you,"
he said, his voice unsteady. "What can I do to
show you how I&mdash;how we worship you for
all you have done, all you have been?"</p>

<p>"There is one thing you can do," Virginia
answered softly. "A favour to me. There is
a little gift I want to make to you, on this day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
of all others. I have been planning it, thinking
of it for a long time. Here is this paper.
Take it and read. You will see then what I
mean, and why I want it so much."</p>

<p>It was a long, folded document of legal aspect
which she thrust into his hand, and in the blue
evening light he opened it. At sight of the first
words the blood leaped to his dark face, marble
no longer, but a man's face, young, handsome,
and virile. He looked from the paper to Virginia.</p>

<p>"Why, it is a deed of gift!" he exclaimed.
"The ch&acirc;teau&mdash;no, Miss Beverly, you are
more than generous, but this cannot be. The
ch&acirc;teau is yours&mdash;I would rather it belonged
to you than to any one on earth, even myself&mdash;and
yours it must remain."</p>

<p>"I bought it for you. It will break my heart if
you refuse," said Virginia, with tears in her voice.</p>

<p>The sound of her pain smote him with anguish.
He lost his head and forgot the barrier
between them&mdash;that he was poor, with a dark
past and an uncertain future, that she was a
great heiress.</p>

<p>"Break your heart!" he repeated. "My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
darling, my angel, I would give all the blood in
mine for one smile from you. I never meant to
say this. I oughtn't to say it now, but&mdash;it
said itself. You must have known before.
You are the very soul of me, though I'm not
worthy to touch your dear hand. I couldn't
take the old home from you&mdash;don't you understand?
I couldn't live there again with this
love of you in my heart, for it would make it so
much the harder. I can't forget you; I would
rather die than forget you. This love is too
sweet to live without, but I know very well that
we can never be anything to each other, and my
plans are all made. As soon as Madeleine is
married I shall go out to Africa and try for luck
as other men have tried&mdash;and found it. It is
better for me to be far away from you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, I love you!" cried Virginia. Then
putting him from her with a quick gesture:
"But it will be I who go far away from you.
I have no right to care. My cousin, Roger
Broom, will take me to England&mdash;anywhere&mdash;it
doesn't matter. I promised long ago to marry
him. In the winter perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the winter you and Max here will be
spending your honeymoon at the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche," said Roger's voice, with a hard cheerfulness.
"That old promise&mdash;why, I never meant
to hold you to it, dear. I don't take bribes,
and&mdash;I saw this coming long ago. I'm quite
content it should be so. You'll forgive me for
overhearing, won't you, girlie? I didn't mean
to give you such a surprise, but I'm not sorry
now. Give me your hand, Max, old man, and
you, Virginia. There! I'm glad it should be the
old cousin-guardian who joins them together."</p>

<p>"You mean it, Roger?" panted Virginia.</p>

<p>"Of course I mean it."</p>

<p>The two hands joined under his. And the
man and the girl were too happy to read anything
save kindness in its nervous pressure.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
